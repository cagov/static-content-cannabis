<p>Good afternoon,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recent enforcement activities in Los Angeles and Riverside Counties have officially pushed the Department of Cannabis Control over the $1 billion mark for illegal cannabis seized from illicit operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This important milestone was reached through close collaboration with local, state, and federal partners and furthers California’s efforts to go after activities that harm communities and the environment, including water theft, threats of violence, elder abuse, and human trafficking to name a few. These operations and the products they produce threaten consumer safety and the vitality of legal and compliant licensees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the last 13 months, the Department’s law enforcement team has led and assisted other agencies in the service of 232 search warrants, seized more than half a million pounds of illegal product, and eradicated over 1.4 million cannabis plants. This effort has removed more than $1 billion worth of potentially harmful and often untested cannabis products from the market and eliminated 120 illegal firearms from the hands of criminal enterprises. The team has also recovered $2.3 million in illegally obtained assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>These enforcement activities are important in eliminating unfair competition, protecting natural resources, and safeguarding our communities. However, this represents only one part of California’s larger strategy to help create a safe, sustainable, and equitable legal cannabis market.</p>

<p>In tandem with law enforcement actions that crack down on illegal activity, DCC staff are working to expand access to tested cannabis products for consumers and lower barriers of participation for businesses. This includes a recent allocation of $20 million to DCC to grant cities and counties with funding that will support the creation of cannabis retail access in areas that currently do not allow it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We hope you’ll help us share this news far and wide and encourage you to check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/2022/07/california-cannabis-enforcement-efforts-help-protect-people-the-environment-and-the-legal-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release DCC issued last month on our enforcement actions</a>&nbsp;to understand our strategy and see our growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Department is grateful to our local, state, and federal partners for their commitment to protect Californians and support an equitable, safe, and sustainable cannabis industry in our state. We thank all our partners across California, including members of the public and legal businesses who report illegal activity to DCC’s complaint portal. These milestones are made possible with your support.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Nicole Elliott&nbsp;<br>DCC Director&nbsp;</p>
