<li>Californians who consume unlicensed cannabis risk ingesting harmful chemicals including pesticides, fertilizers, and heavy metals simply because they are unable to distinguish between licensed and unlicensed retailers. [eventually link to contaminants report]</li>

<li>While state and federal fair labor practices protect laborers in the legal market, workers at illegal cannabis operators may be subjected to wage theft, violence, and hazardous conditions.</li>

<ul>
<li>Since illegal cannabis sales are untaxed, communities lose millions of yearly revenue that could be used to strengthen the economy and fund local programs.</li>

<li>The unlicensed market has lower business costs which makes it difficult for legitimate growers and retailers to thrive in the industry and incentivizes further participation in the illegal market.</li>
