<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Frequently asked questions</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Q:  How can I tell if I have an annual license or a provisional license?   </h3>

<p>A:&nbsp;&nbsp; To determine if you have an annual or provisional license, find the “license stage” by searching for your license on <a href="https://search.cannabis.ca.gov/">Cannabis Unified License Search</a>.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Q:&nbsp; How can I transition my provisional license to an annual license?&nbsp;</h3>

<p>A:&nbsp; Provisional licensees must comply with all annual license requirements for the applicable license type to transition from a provisional license to an annual license. To resolve any outstanding annual license requirements, the designated responsible party must reference all deficiency notice(s) and submit any requested documentation to DCC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you already submitted all final documentation and have questions regarding the status, email <a href="mailto:info@cannabis.ca.gov">info@cannabis.ca.gov</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Q:&nbsp; What if I fail to transition to an annual license and can no longer renew my provisional license?</h3>

<p>A:&nbsp; Failure to transition to annual licensure before your provisional license expires may result in:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The suspension, cancellation, revocation, or natural expiration of your provisional license and</li>

<li>The denial of your annual license application&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>If you cannot or choose not to transition to an annual license, you may request to withdraw the application at any time before DCC denies the application.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If DCC denies your annual license application, you may request an appeal hearing within 30 calendar days of the date stated on the denial notice.  &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>If your license is no longer valid, you must cease all commercial cannabis activity immediately including the sale, receipt, or transfer of cannabis or cannabis products.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Q:&nbsp; How will I know if DCC is considering suspension or revocation of my provisional license?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>

<p>A: DCC will issue a notice of provisional license review. The notice will describe: &nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The nature and facts of each violation&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>How to correct the violation(s) to achieve compliance and&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>The action DCC is considering, such as suspension or revocation of the provisional license, or denial of the annual application&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>The notice will also provide instructions for requesting an informal meeting with DCC to discuss the matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Q: What should I do if DCC terminates my provisional license because I can’t or choose not to transition to an annual before my eligibility to renew my provisional license expires?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>

<p>A: If DCC terminates your provisional license for any reason, you must sell or destroy all cannabis and cannabis products on the premises before the license becomes inactive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If DCC terminates your license and cannabis or cannabis products remain on the premises, a licensed distributor or microbusiness authorized for distribution may obtain approval from DCC to buy and distribute your inventory.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Distributors and microbusinesses authorized to engage in distribution may request approval to purchase cannabis or cannabis products from a terminated license by submitting a written request for authorization to DCC using the form<a href="/2024/01/notifications-and-requests-regarding-regulatory-compliance/"> DCC-LIC-028</a>. The request must be submitted within 14 calendar days of license termination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Q:&nbsp; Who can I contact if I have questions?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>

<p>A:&nbsp; The DRP for the license can email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@cannabis.ca.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">info@cannabis.ca.gov</a> from their registered email address&nbsp;for more information.&nbsp; Please include the license number in the inquiry.</p>
