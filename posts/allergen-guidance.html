<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is an allergy?</h2>

<p>A food allergy is an autoimmune response to a food triggered by the body’s immune system. Food allergies occur when the body&#8217;s immune system reacts to certain proteins in food. Food allergies can cause mild symptoms (e.g., hives, itching, gastrointestinal issues), but in rare cases can trigger a severe and life-threatening reaction known as anaphylaxis.</p>

<p>Properly identifying and labeling allergens in cannabis products and preventing allergen cross-contact are important factors in ensuring the safety of consumers who suffer from food allergies.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the major food allergens?</h2>

<p>The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) follows federal law that recognizes nine major food allergens: Milk, Eggs, Tree Nuts, Wheat, Peanuts, Soybeans, Sesame, Fish, and Shellfish. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 4, §15000, subd. (c).)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">DCC regulations and allergens</h2>

<p>To protect those with food allergies and sensitivities, DCC regulations require that licensees who handle allergens establish and implement a written allergen control program as part of the Product Quality Plan to prevent both labeling mistakes and allergen cross-contact between product types. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 4, §17214, subd. (d)(3).) Licensees must implement an allergen control program that is appropriate for their specific manufacturing activities.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Key elements of an allergen control program</h2>

<ul>
<li>Accurately listing all major allergens present in the cannabis product on the ingredient list of the product labeling.</li>

<li>Providing accurate allergen warnings on the cannabis product label in the form of a contains statement – the word “contains” followed by a list of the allergens contained in the cannabis product.</li>

<li>Implementing good manufacturing practices (GMPs) and other allergen controls during manufacturing to prevent allergen cross-contact between product types and labeling mistakes.</li>
</ul>
