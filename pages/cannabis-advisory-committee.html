<p>The Cannabis Advisory Committee (CAC) is tasked with advising DCC on the development of relevant standards and regulations for commercial cannabis businesses, including those necessary to protect public health and safety.&nbsp;<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&amp;sectionNum=26014.">These requirements are guided by Business and Professions codes</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The CAC is expected to provide valuable input to DCC’s development of regulations and standards through its comprehensive representation and each individual member’s unique perspective on consumer, community, and market issues. In addition, the CAC will provide an important venue for DCC to hold robust public discussions that support the development of an innovative regulatory framework that benefits all Californians and results in a safe, sustainable, and equitable cannabis market.</p>
