<p>The DCC provided notice on July 6, 2022 of modifications to the proposed text of regulations that were initially noticed in March.

<h3>DCC Conflict of Interest Code </h3>

<p><strong>Type</strong>: Special rulemaking</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Under review</p>

<p>California law requires all state and local government agencies to establish and follow a Conflict of Interest Code. These codes require agency officials who routinely participate in decisions to publicly disclose personal financial information. They designate: </p>

<ul><li>Which employee positions must file a Form 700 Statement of Economic Interests </li><li>The financial interests that those employees must disclose</li></ul>

<p>DCC is proposing to adopt a Conflict of Interest Code. </p>

<p>The Political Reform Act prohibits public officials and employees from using their official positions to influence governmental decisions in which they have financial interests. A Conflict of Interest Code helps identify and disclose potential conflicts of interest. Learn more about the Political Reform Act on the <a href="https://www.fppc.ca.gov/learn/rules-on-conflict-of-interest-codes.html#:~:text=Why%20Government%20Agencies%20Must%20Adopt%20a%20Conflict%20of%20Interest%20Code&amp;text=To%20help%20identify%20potential%20conflicts,Economic%20Interests%20(Form%20700).">Fair Political Practices Commission’s website</a>.</p>
