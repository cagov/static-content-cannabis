<p>Assembly Bill 97, a trailer bill passed by the California State Legislature and signed into law earlier this month, contains provisions that modify the Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA). Key provisions affecting cannabis cultivators and potential applicants are highlighted below.</p>
<p><strong>Provisional Licenses</strong></p>
<p>Applicants are no longer required to hold or have held a temporary license to be eligible for a provisional license, and the sunset date for provisional licenses has been extended to January 1, 2022.</p>
<p>Provisional licensees must adhere to all statutory and regulatory requirements, including use of the California Cannabis Track-and-Trace system. To be eligible for a provisional license, the applicant must submit a complete annual license application and be in the process of complying with local ordinances and completing requirements for the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).</p>
<p><strong>For Applicants</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All those with pending annual license applications will be evaluated to determine eligibility for a provisional license. No action is needed from the applicant unless contacted for more information regarding an application.</li>
<li>New applicants must complete the online cannabis cultivation license application: <a href="https://aca-prod.accela.com/CALCANNABIS/">https://aca-prod.accela.com/CALCANNABIS/</a>. Eligibility for a provisional license will be assessed during the application review process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applicants with questions can contact us by calling 1-833-CALGROW (1-833-225-4769).</p>
<p><strong>For Local Jurisdictions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We will contact the local jurisdiction during the review process to verify the applicant’s compliance with local ordinances. Once a provisional license is issued, we will maintain close communication with local jurisdictions about the status of the licensee’s authorization, including when city and county governments complete their cannabis-specific permitting and approval processes.</li>
<li>We will continue to conduct inspections and follow up with provisional and annual license holders to ensure they are meeting all state statutory and regulatory requirements.</li>
