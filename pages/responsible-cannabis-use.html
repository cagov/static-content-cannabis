<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Responsible consumption</h2>

<p>Your reaction to cannabis may be different from that of others, and can depend on:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Your body composition and existing tolerance of cannabis or other substances</li>

<li>The THC content, amount of cannabis consumed, and your consumption method</li>
</ul>

<p>Edibles and inhalables are common consumption methods for new consumers.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Edibles</h3>

<p>Edibles are cannabis-infused food and drink products, such as brownies, gummies, or iced teas. Your body metabolizes edibles more slowly than inhaled cannabis, taking up to two hours to begin feeling the effects and up to four hours to feel the full effects. Start low, go slow!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Inhalables</h3>

<p>Inhalables are products which can be smoked (via pipe, bong, or pre-roll), vaped (via vape cartridge or vape pen), or dabbed (via dab rig or dab pen).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Responsible living</h2>

<p>Cannabis consumption can impact your daily life. Keep reading to learn how to promote a safer environment for yourself and those around you.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Employment</h3>

<p>Know your workplace&#8217;s cannabis policies, as your employer may prohibit you from using cannabis.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Storage</h3>

<p>California has strict labeling laws to warn when products contain cannabis, but these products may still be mistaken for regular food or candy. </p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Keep cannabis in a sealed child-resistant package when not in use</li>

<li>Store and dispose of cannabis products where it cannot be easily seen or accessed by children or pets</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Equipment and vehicles</h3>

<p>Cannabis can impact your ability to drive. Driving under the influence of cannabis is illegal, with the same potential penalties as driving under the influence of alcohol.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Consumption during pregnancy or breastfeeding</h3>

<p>If you are pregnant, may be pregnant, or breastfeeding, you should not consume cannabis and should talk to your doctor.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Child safety</h3>

<p>Cannabis affects children more than adults, putting them at a higher risk for adverse effects, especially with edibles.</p>

<p>If you suspect a child has consumed cannabis, call California Poison Control at <a href="tel:8002221222">(800) 222-1222</a>.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pet safety</h3>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Disposal</h3>
