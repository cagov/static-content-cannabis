<p>If you are the Designated Responsible Party (DRP) for the business, youâ€™ll be sent any deficiency notifications for the main license application. Deficiencies display under Announcements when you log in. Also, your main application record now shows a Status of Additional Information Needed, and a License Application Amendment displays in your Licenses list.</p>

<p>Note: If an Owner Application amendment is sent, the DRP also receives an amendment for the main application, even if there is no deficiency in the main application. You must respond to that notice as well. DCC cannot issue a license if deficiencies are outstanding.</p>
