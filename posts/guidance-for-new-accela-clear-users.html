<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Account activation</h2>

<p>Users will receive two emails during system migration activities the week of November 12, 2023. One email will be an account activation email. The other email will be a password reset email with instructions on how to access the system. Once users reset their password and are logged in, they will be able to see their manufacturing licenses on the ‘My Records’ page. A section of the ‘My Records’ page will clearly display all associated manufacturing license records and applications.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Logging in</h2>

<p>Enter your existing username and the temporary password received via email. </p>

<p>After entering the temporary password, you will be prompted to change your password.</p>

<p>You will then be prompted to create a security question.</p>
<div class="wp-block-ca-design-system-page-alert cagov-block"><cagov-page-alert data-icon="ca-gov-icon-cannabis" data-message="If you are not able to successfully use the temporary password link, please contact the Department at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:licensing@cannabis.ca.gov&quot;&gt;licensing@cannabis.ca.gov&lt;/a&gt;. The temporary password links do eventually expire for security reasons. Departmental staff are prepared to assist anyone experiencing issues accessing their account."></cagov-page-alert>
    </div>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">My records</h2>

<p>After creating and answering the security question you are logged into the &#8216;Home&#8217; page. To view an existing manufacturing license or application converted from PEGA you can select the ‘My Records’ function.</p>

<p>The ‘My Records’ screen has two sections to display all licenses and applications associated to a user’s account.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Applicants and licensees</h3>

<p>The ‘Applicants and Licenses’ section will contain non-manufacturing licenses, applications and renewals. This section will also display all Owner Submittal records: the CLEaR-generated Owner Submittals and converted PEGA Owner Submittals. Owner Submittal records associated with a converted record will have a pre-fix of ‘P’ (e.g. P-21027588-OWN).</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Manufacturing</h3>

<p>The ‘Manufacturing’ section of the ‘My Records’ page will contain all non-Owner Submittal records converted from PEGA. Within the ‘Manufacturing’ section users can access the Renewal and Change in Operations functionality.</p>
