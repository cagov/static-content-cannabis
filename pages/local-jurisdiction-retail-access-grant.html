<p>Nearly two-thirds of California cities and counties <a href="/cannabis-laws/where-cannabis-businesses-are-allowed/">do not allow</a> the establishment of any regulated cannabis retailers within their jurisdictions. This limits consumer access to regulated, tested cannabis and cannabis products.</p>

<h2>Funding opportunity</h2>

<p>The Retail Access Grant provides local governments with resources to develop and implement cannabis retailer licensing programs. Up to $20 million total funding is available, distributed in two phases.</p>

<p>A local jurisdiction (city or county) is eligible for funding if it both:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does <strong>not</strong> currently have a cannabis retail licensing program, and</li>

<li>Has a plan to develop and implement a cannabis retail licensing program</li>
</ul>

<p>Funding can be used for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support of equity applicants and licensees</li>

<li>Environmental reviews</li>

<li>Permitting expenses</li>

<li>Personnel costs</li>
</ul>

<p>By providing this assistance to cities and counties, the Retail Access Grant aims to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Provide consumers with reliable access to regulated, tested cannabis</li>

<li>Reduce demand in the illicit market</li>

<li>Establish enough cannabis retail stores statewide to meet existing consumer demand</li>
</ul>

<h2>Funding rounds</h2>

<p>Funding will be distributed in two phases:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Phase I</strong> provides funding to support local jurisdictions in the development and implementation of a local cannabis retailer licensing program.
<ul>
<li>Up to $10 million in total funding is available in Phase I, and awards will be announced by June 20, 2023.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Phase II</strong> awards additional funding after the local jurisdiction issues cannabis retailer permits.
<ul>
<li>At least $10 million in total funding is available; awards will be made for each cannabis retailer permit issued by a Phase I recipient, beginning on or after June 30, 2023.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional funding will be awarded in both phases of this grant program for local governments that adopt equity programs and issue cannabis retailer licenses to equity businesses.</p>

<h2>Priority funding</h2>

<p>This grant program prioritizes funding to local jurisdictions that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Propose to assist cannabis equity businesses</li>

<li>Address gaps in consumer access to safe and regulated cannabis</li>

<li>Plan to permit cannabis retailers through existing business permitting processes</li>
</ul>

<p>Local jurisdictions that meet these criteria will be eligible for priority points. Applications with priority points will be processed first.</p>

<h3>Priority Area: Equity licensing opportunities</h3>

<p>DCC is committed to providing equity to communities harmed by past cannabis criminalization through local pathways to licensure and business success. Local jurisdictions that submit a plan to incorporate equity into their permitting process will be eligible for priority review.</p>

<h3>Priority Area: Gaps in consumer access to legal cannabis</h3>

<p>This grant program aims to provide consumers with better access to regulated, tested cannabis and reducing the need for consumers to turn to the illicit market. In 18 counties across the state, the proportion of licensed cannabis retail outlets is low compared to its share of consumer consumption:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amador County, Butte County, Contra Costa County, Fresno County, Glenn County, Kern County, Lassen County, Madera County, Orange County, Placer County, San Benito County, San Diego County, San Joaquin County, San Mateo County, Santa Clara County, Sutter County, Tehama County, Yuba County</li>
</ul>

<p>Because cannabis consumers within these areas would benefit from expanded access to licensed cannabis, these counties – and the cities within them – will receive priority review should they apply for a grant and implement a permitting program.</p>

<h3>Priority area: Existing business permitting pathways</h3>

<p>The experience of local jurisdictions that have proactively regulated cannabis has shown that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Establishing cannabis-specific licensing programs can be resource and time intensive</li>

<li>• Utilizing existing permitting and review pathways can simplify cannabis permitting processes</li>
</ul>

<p>To support local jurisdictions in quickly developing cannabis retailer licensing programs, priority review will be awarded to jurisdictions that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Propose to license cannabis businesses through existing business permitting process already in existence for non-cannabis businesses</li>

<li>Propose to license only cannabis retail businesses that are eligible for categorical exemption under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)</li>
</ul>
