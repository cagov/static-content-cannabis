<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cannabis Academic Research Grants</strong></h3>

<p>As of May 2025, &nbsp;the vast majority of states allow medical-use, and 24 states allow adult-use of cannabis. Despite changes in state policy, cannabis is still classified by the federal government as a Schedule 1 Controlled Substance. This limits research opportunities and our collective understanding of cannabis and its effects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>DCC is seeking proposals for research projects that&nbsp;advance public understanding of cannabis and effects of legalization.&nbsp;Researchers at California public universities are eligible to apply. Up to $30 &nbsp;million in grants will be awarded.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Funding for local jurisdictions</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Local Jurisdiction Retail Access Grant</h3>

<p>As of February 1, 2023,&nbsp;<a href="/cannabis-laws/where-cannabis-businesses-are-allowed/">61% of California cities and counties (327)</a>&nbsp;do not allow cannabis retailers. This makes it harder for consumers to access safe, tested cannabis products.&nbsp;</p>

<p>California allocated $20 million to help local governments establish cannabis retail licensing programs. This grant program aims to provide existing consumers with sufficient access to legal, tested cannabis, promoting consumer safety and &nbsp;reducing demand in the illicit market.</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p>A local jurisdiction (city, county, or city and county) is eligible for funding if it:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Prior to July 1, 2022, did <strong>not</strong>  have a cannabis retail licensing program in existence; &nbsp;</li>

<li>Has a plan to develop and implement a cannabis retail licensing program.</li>
</ul>
