<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Protecting consumers</h2>

<p>Whether consumers are using cannabis for medical reasons or purely for recreational purposes, it is important that they purchase their cannabis products from a licensed retailer. Buying cannabis products from licensed retailers provides consumers with peace of mind knowing that their products have been tested. &nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Individuals</h3>

<ul>
<li>Californians who consume unlicensed cannabis risk ingesting harmful chemicals including pesticides, fertilizers, and heavy metals simply because they are unable to distinguish between licensed and unlicensed retailers. </li>

<li>While state and federal fair labor practices protect laborers in the legal market, workers at illegal cannabis operators may be subjected to wage theft, violence, and hazardous conditions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Communities</h3>

<ul>
<li>Communities with higher rates of illegal consumption tend to see <a href="https://econ.appstate.edu/RePEc/pdf/wp2112.pdf">higher rates of violent crime,</a> endangering residents, families and businesses. </li>

<li>Furthermore, these communities lose out on vital tax revenue to fund youth education prevention, early intervention and treatment, environmental programs, and public safety.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">State</h3>

<ul>
<li>Since illegal cannabis sales are untaxed, communities lose millions of yearly revenue that could be used to strengthen the economy and fund local programs.</li>

<li>The unlicensed market has lower business costs which makes it difficult for legitimate growers and retailers to thrive in the industry and incentivizes further participation in the illegal market.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Real California Cannabis?</h2>
