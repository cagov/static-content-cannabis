<p>Based on the nature of the cultivation license change requested, DCC will calculate fees due or refund owed.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Calculating fees for limited operations status at time of renewal</h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Calculating fees for multiple license changes</h2>

<p>How fees are calculated when a cultivation licensee changes their expiration date and makes one of the following cultivation license changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Places their cultivation license on limited operations status, or </li>

<li>Reduces the canopy size of the cultivation license</li>
</ul>
