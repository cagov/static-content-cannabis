<p>Manufacturers extract cannabinoids and terpenes from cannabis plants and make products out of the extract. The types of products they make vary widely and include: food and beverages, vape cartridges, lotions and balms, lozenges and sublingual sprays, pills and tablets, and dab, shatter and wax.</p>

<p>Cannabis manufacturers use techniques and processes common in other types of consumer product manufacturing. Manufacturing steps differ based on the type of manufacturing, but generally include:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Extraction of cannabinoids</li>

<li>Post-processing (refinement) of cannabis extract</li>

<li>Infusion of extract or plant material with other ingredients</li>

<li>Packaging and labeling cannabis products</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="licenses">Manufacturing licenses</h2>

<p>You need a&nbsp;manufacturing license&nbsp;to make cannabis products in California. The type of manufacturing license you need depends on:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>What activities you do</li>

<li>Whether you do extraction and post processing</li>

<li>What types of chemicals you use (if any)</li>
</ul>

<p>You need a different license if you manufacture in a shared-use facility.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="best-practices">Good manufacturing practices</h2>

<p>The Department of Cannabis Control’s regulations require manufacturers to follow good manufacturing practices (GMPs) when making products. GMPs help ensure products are: </p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Free of contaminants and safe for consumers</li>

<li>Produced consistently every time</li>

<li>Labeled correctly</li>
</ul>

<p>Manufacturers must demonstrate GMPs by:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Maintaining a sanitary facility, equipment and utensils</li>

<li>Using written procedures and instructions</li>

<li>Documenting work</li>

<li>Protecting against contamination</li>

<li>Including controls in processes</li>

<li>Practicing personal hygiene</li>
</ul>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="documentation">Documenting manufacturing processes</h2>

<p>Manufacturers must keep up-to-date documents with their procedures and instructions for making products.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Product quality plan</h3>

<p>A product quality plan includes:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>An assessment of the potential hazards in your facility and manufacturing practices</li>

<li>The preventative measures you use to mitigate risks</li>
</ul>

<p>You must have a product quality plan for each type of product manufactured.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Closed-loop extraction systems</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="/2023/12/checklist-closed-loop-extraction-systems/">Checklist: closed-loop extraction systems</a></h3>

<p>Cannabis manufacturers who utilize closed-loop extraction systems must ensure their extraction systems are operated and maintained according to the requirements established by DCC. These requirements govern the use of volatile or asphyxiating solvents, or flammable liquids, permissible extraction types, closed-loop extraction systems, and the continued certification of closed-loop extraction systems. This document is intended to outline the requirements that closed-loop extraction system operators must follow to ensure the compliant use of extraction systems.</p>
