<p>A vibrant, compliant legal cannabis market benefits and protects the safety of all Californians. DCC&#8217;s compliance efforts support this by:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Licensing locations that meet state requirements&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Educating licensees about their responsibilities under their state license &nbsp;</li>

<li>Conducting routine inspections of licensed premises &nbsp;</li>

<li>Investigating alleged violations of commercial cannabis laws &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>DCC works with licensees to gain voluntary compliance. For example, DCC may issue a Notice to Comply, which identifies violations, provides direction as to how to correct the violations, and provides a deadline for correcting them. Serious violations or recurring violations may also be addressed by:&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Denying an application for commercial cannabis licensure&nbsp;</li>

<li>Issuing a citation that may include:&nbsp;
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Fine – up to $5,000 per violation (licensed person) or $30,000 per violation (unlicensed person)&nbsp;</li>

<li>Order of abatement&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Suspending a license for a period of time&nbsp;</li>

<li>Revoking a license&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Imposing a fine based on the disciplinary guidelines&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
