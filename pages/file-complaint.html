<p>DCC licenses and regulates all commercial cannabis activity in California. This includes the growing, manufacturing, distribution, testing, and sale of cannabis and cannabis products.  If you suspect unlawful business practices, you can file a complaint with DCC. Although some complaints about specific environmental, labor, civil rights, and tax issues may be best handled by other departments, DCC reviews all complaints closely and may make referrals to partner agencies. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When to file a complaint with DCC &nbsp;</h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to file a complaint&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Complaints made to the Department can be filed anonymously and can be made against licensed or unlicensed cannabis businesses. Gather all of your materials ahead of time. The best complaints provide as much detail as possible, including &nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Name of business, person(s), or licensee name.</li>

<li>Address of the business&nbsp;</li>

<li>Phone number of the business&nbsp;</li>

<li>Date when you witnessed the activities that are the subject of your complaint&nbsp;</li>

<li>Description of observations. concerns, possible violations.</li>

<li>Documentation, including photos, receipts, timecards, certifications, or copies of email or other communications. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Be aware that incomplete complaints &#8211; like those without addresses, business names, or contact information &#8211; can prevent DCC from gathering additional information it needs to evaluate your complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to expect after you file a complaint </h2>

<p>There are several steps we take after a complaint has been filed.&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list" type="1">
<li>DCC staff evaluate whether the activity would violate laws or regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>If so, they will determine if the issue falls within our primary jurisdiction over commercial cannabis activity or if it should be referred to a partner agency.&nbsp;</li>

<li>For matters within our primary jurisdiction, DCC will review and gather relevant information to determine the appropriate course of action in response to the complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>We may reach out in case we need additional information, so even if you chose to submit a complaint anonymously, we recommend leaving an email address so we can get in touch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you would like to check in on the status of your complaint, you can <a href="mailto:complaints@cannabis.ca.gov">email us</a> with your complaint reference number provided to you when you filed the complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
