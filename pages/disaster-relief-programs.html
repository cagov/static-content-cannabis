<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Which disasters qualify</h2>

<p>California experiences a variety of events that may be considered disasters including wildfires, floods, earthquakes, and winter storms. DCC may offer regulatory relief if these events are:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>State of emergency proclaimed by the Governor</li>

<li>Local emergency proclaimed by the city or county</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Facing immediate threat</h2>

<p>You don’t need to contact DCC before moving cannabis or cannabis products if you are facing an immediate threat: a licensee may move cannabis or cannabis products&nbsp;<strong>immediately&nbsp;</strong>if threatened by a wildfire or other disaster. After moving the cannabis or cannabis products, licensees must meet the following requirements:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The cannabis and/or cannabis products must be moved to a secure location where access is restricted to the licensee and the licensee’s employees and contractors.</li>

<li><strong>Within 24 hours&nbsp;</strong>of moving the cannabis, notify DCC that the cannabis has been moved. Do this by emailing&nbsp;<a href="mailto:DisasterRelief@cannabis.ca.gov">DisasterRelief@cannabis.ca.gov</a>.</li>

<li>Upon request, you must allow DCC staff to access and inspect the location where the cannabis has been moved.</li>

<li><strong>Within 14 days&nbsp;</strong>of moving the cannabis, notify DCC describing your request for regulatory relief using form&nbsp;<a href="/2023/10/request-for-disaster-relief/">DCC-8101</a>&nbsp;or providing the same information in writing. Email the request to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:DisasterRelief@cannabis.ca.gov">DisasterRelief@cannabis.ca.gov</a>.</li>
</ul>
