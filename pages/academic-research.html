<p>Cannabis is a Schedule I drug, which means there are strict rules for studying it in the United States. As a result, we do not know as much as we would like about cannabis’s effects on the body.</p>

<p>Some of the revenue collected from cannabis taxes funds grants. This helps expand our knowledge about cannabis.</p>
