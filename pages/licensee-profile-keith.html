<h2>About Gorilla Rx</h2>

<p>After years of advocating to honor the intent of the Los Angeles Social Equity Program, Kika Keith opened Gorilla Rx, the first black-woman-owned dispensary in Los Angeles. Gorilla Rx is a landmark in the South-After years of advocating to honor the intent of the Los Angeles Social Equity Program, Kika Keith opened Gorilla Rx, the first Black-woman-owned dispensary in Los Angeles. Gorilla Rx is a landmark in the South-Central community honoring its “crafted on Crenshaw” motto. The dispensary features the largest Black-owned selection of cannabis goods in Los Angeles and a crew of knowledgeable, attentive budtenders committed to community education and advocacy.</p>

<h2>Benefits of being in the legal marketplace</h2>

<p>“The legal cannabis marketplace has the potential to change lives, shape culture, and empower underserved communities,” Keith said. With over 25 years of experience building high-growth businesses and community organizations operating at the intersection of social justice and cannabis, she feels confident sharing her story and passing on her wisdom to others.</p>

<p>The legal marketplace is central to Keith’s vision to create a truly equitable industry. “The goal is to create and maintain an equitable supply chain that can coexist within a thriving marketplace. Despite the legalities, there’s still work to be done to ensure that the communities most harmed by the War on Drugs receive philanthropic benefits through license holders to give back to those disproportionately impacted. License holders can spearhead and participate in programs such as neighborhood clean ups, beautification projects, and compassionate care.”</p>

<h2>Pride in being a licensed retailer</h2>

<p>Reflecting on the importance of her license, Keith said, “Considering our people have never been allowed to partake in the economic upside of industries such as cotton, alcohol, and tobacco, there is certainly a genuine pride that comes with being the first Black-woman-owned social equity dispensary in Los Angeles. Our shelves hold the largest variety of Black-owned brands adding to that pride in ways you cannot imagine! We plan to continue to find innovative ways to return the love that the community has shown us as our business grows.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keith helps other minority entrepreneurs find resources and technical assistance, too, going out of her way to ensure that the door to success remains wide open.&nbsp;&nbsp;Keith is launching a cannabis equity training center next door to her facility to train the next generation of dispensary owners, and workers. She also educates consumers on the benefits of cannabis</p>

<p>While most of her time is devoted to her business, Keith also advocates for policies that will help ensure minorities have a significant share of the market. She is also working to create opportunities for minorities outside of California by traveling throughout the country to counsel other groups and organizations on how to develop successful social equity programs.&nbsp;</p>
