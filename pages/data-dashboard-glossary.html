<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Item Categories</h3>

<p>Item Categories are classifications that define the type and quantity type of a cannabis good. When a retailer makes a sale, the Item Category of the cannabis good sold is captured. Item Categories can be count-based, weight-based, or volume-based, depending on the cannabis good and measurement type. In some circumstances, some Item Categories may be discontinued over time and others may be introduced. In these circumstances, dramatic changes in trend lines may appear. In such cases, this represents a change in data entry procedures and not a data error or actual industry trend.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Count-based Categories – “Each”</h3>

<p>Count-based categories track the unit of measurement that is either one whole unit (such as a pre-roll or seed), a weight-based unit (such as an eighth ounce of flower or 1 gram of concentrate), or a volume-based unit (such as 16-ounce beverage). With count-based categories, the quantity of a cannabis good within each count can vary, depending how the base measurement of the “each” is defined by the licensee. A major exception to this is the cannabis flower and cannabis shake item categories. These categories have pre-defined weight-based measures, such as “Flower (packaged eighth – each)”. For this Item Category, every “each” is one-eighth ounces, or 3.5 grams of cannabis flower.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Weight-Based Categories</h3>

<p>Weight-based categories track the weight of a cannabis good. This can be measured in grams, kilograms, milligrams, ounces, or pounds. The actual weight of an Item Category is defined by the licensee. Common weight-based categories include solid cannabis edibles, vape cartridges (e.g., 0.5g or 1g), and concentrates.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Volume-Based Categories</h3>

<p>Volume-based categories track the volume of a cannabis good. This can be measured in fluid ounces, gallons, liters, milliliters, pints, or quarts. The actual volume of an Item Category is defined by the licensee. Typically, liquids are measured by volume-based categories. Volume-based item categories include things like vape cartridges, liquid edibles (e.g., cannabis beverages), tinctures, and topicals.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Price Per Unit</h3>

<p>The calculation for price per unit for Item Categories and Item Groups is Total Sales divided by the Total Units sold. However, it is important to note that an individual unit within an item category can vary based on the weight, volume, or count, as it is defined by the licensee. For example, a single pre-roll unit could mean one, individual 0.5g pre-roll, or it could mean a package of 6 1g pre-rolls. A single edible unit could mean one 10mg gummy, or 100 5mg mints. Therefore, many of the price per unit calculations are averages of units of unknown quantities. A major exception is the price per unit calculations for flower (packaged – each) and shake (packaged – each), as these have pre-defined weights associated with them that do not vary. Additionally, discounted prices for individual units are not adjusted. The actual price at the time of sale for a unit is not adjusted after the fact. For example, if a retailer offered a buy-one-get-one for one cent offer, the price for the individual unit sold at the discounted price of one cent is reflected as one cent and not adjusted in the source data.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Customer Type</h3>

<p>When entering a sale in track and trace, a retailer can indicate that a customer is a &#8220;consumer&#8221;, &#8220;patient&#8221;, or &#8220;caregiver&#8221;. “Consumers” are adults 21 years of age or older that do not identify themselves as medicinal cannabis patients or caregivers. “Patients” are individuals 18 or older who identify as a medicinal cannabis patient by displaying a physician’s recommendation or Medical Marijuana Identification Card. “Caregivers” are individuals who are designated by a qualified medicinal cannabis patient to obtain cannabis on their behalf.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the customer type data is likely not reflective of the total number of medicinal cannabis patients as many medicinal patients who are 21 or older may not identify as such at time of purchase. The primary times an individual might identify as a medicinal cannabis patient are (1) when shopping at a medicinal-only retailer (where proof of a physician&#8217;s recommendation is required), (2) when seeking to purchase products with higher THC concentrations than are allowed in the adult-use market, (3) when seeking to purchase more cannabis than is allowed under the adult-use daily purchase limit restrictions, or (4) when seeking to obtain the sales and use tax exemption by presenting a medical marijuana identification card.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="harvest">Harvest Report Glossary</h2>

<p>Data Sources – The information contained in the accompanying tabs was derived from data entered into the California Cannabis Track-and-Trace system by licensed cannabis businesses. The Department does not make any warranties or guarantees regarding the accuracy of the source data.</p>

<p>The Report consists of data from 2020 –  2023.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Harvest Years</h3>

<p>Harvest Years are combined into calendar years (e.g. January 1 – December 31).</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Harvest Quarters</h3>

<p>Harvest Quarters are collections of three months of a given year. The quarter numbering is oriented around a calendar year (e.g. Q1 – January 1 – March 31; Q2 – April 1 – June 30; Q3 – July 1 – September 30; Q4 – October 1 – December 31).</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Facility Type</h3>

<p>Licensed cultivators are grouped into one of five different categories: indoor, outdoor, nursery, mixed-light, and microbusiness.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Indoor</strong> &#8211; means the cultivation of cannabis within a permanent structure using exclusively artificial light or within any type of structure using artificial light at a rate above twenty-five watts per square foot.</li>

<li><strong>Outdoor</strong> &#8211; means the cultivation of mature cannabis without the use of artificial lighting in the canopy area at any point in time.</li>

<li><strong>Nursery</strong> &#8211; means all activities associated with producing clones, immature plants, seeds, and other agricultural products used specifically for the propagation and cultivation of cannabis.</li>

<li><strong>Mixed-Light</strong> &#8211; means the cultivation of mature cannabis in a greenhouse, hoop-house, glasshouse, conservatory, hothouse, or other similar structure using a combination of natural light and either of the following: (A) “Mixed-light Tier 1,” without the use of artificial light or the use of artificial light at a rate above zero, but no more than six watts per square foot; or (B) “Mixed-light Tier 2,” the use of artificial light at a rate above six and below or equal to twenty-five watts per square foot.</li>

<li><strong>Microbusiness</strong> &#8211; means a licensee that is authorized to engage in cultivation of cannabis on an area less than 10,000 square feet and to act as a licensed distributor, Level 1 manufacturer, and retailer.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">UOM</h3>

<p>Unit of Measure. This value can be used to adjust the weight measurement in the data display. The unit of measure only impacts weight-based measurements. Adjusting the unit of measurement will not change items measured by count, such as plant count and package count.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Harvest Batch</h3>

<p>A specifically identified quantity of dried flower or trim, leaves, and other cannabis plant matter that is harvested at the same time, and, if applicable, cultivated using the same pesticides and other agricultural chemicals.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Plant Count</h3>

<p>The number of plants in the harvest batch.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Package Count</h3>

<p>The number of packages made from the harvest batch.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Waste Weight</h3>

<p>Weight of all waste produced from a harvest batch.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Moisture Loss Weight</h3>

<p>The presumed weight attributed to moisture loss during the drying/curing process. This value will be zero until all waste from the harvest batch is recorded and all usable product is packaged.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Packaged Weight</h3>

<p>Total packaged weight of all packages created directly from the harvest.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Wet Weight</h3>

<p>Wet weight of all plants in the harvest batch.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Harvest County</h3>

<p>The broader county where the cultivator, or microbusiness engaged in cultivation, is located. This is not representative of the local licensing authority (i.e. the city or county that permitted the business), just the broader county in which the business is located.</p>
