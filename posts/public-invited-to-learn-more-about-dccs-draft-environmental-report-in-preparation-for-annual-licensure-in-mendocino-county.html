<p><em>DCC prepares Notice of Preparation documentation and  will hold a public scoping meeting for a draft environmental impact report for the licensing of commercial cannabis cultivation in the Mendocino County Project. </em></p>

<p>The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) intends to prepare an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the Licensing of Commercial Cannabis Cultivation in Mendocino County Project (Project). DCC and Mendocino County have worked in partnership to support provisional cultivation licensees’ transition to annual licensure within the County. The Project consists of the DCC actions to approve annual licensing of such commercial cannabis cultivation operations in Mendocino County under California Code of Regulations, title 4, section 15002. The EIR will programmatically evaluate the environmental impacts of the DCC’s annual licensing of commercial cannabis cultivation operations in the county as well as the environmental impacts of future licensed commercial cannabis cultivation operations. DCC, which is responsible for the issuance of state commercial cannabis cultivation licenses, will be lead agency in accordance with CEQA in connection with the issuance of such licenses in Mendocino County.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
