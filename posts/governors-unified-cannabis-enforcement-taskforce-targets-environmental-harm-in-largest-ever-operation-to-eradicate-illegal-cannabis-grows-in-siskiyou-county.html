<p>Governor Gavin Newsom’s Unified Cannabis Enforcement Taskforce (UCETF) has continued its work to combat the illicit cannabis market, conducting an operation in Siskiyou County last month.</p>

<p>The operation targeted illegal cannabis cultivation sites that threaten the environment, workers, and other members of the public. The sites in question were associated with suspected environmental violations, including the use of unlawful pesticides and other toxic chemicals. These dangerous chemicals not only degrade California’s natural resources, but also endanger workers and others exposed to them.</p>

<p>The operation included 24 search warrants, served between July 11 through 13 on unlicensed commercial cannabis cultivation sites in the Whitney Creek, Harry Cash, and Shasta Vistas areas in Siskiyou County. It eradicated 67,045 illegal cannabis plants, seized 8,019.75 pounds of illegal processed cannabis, worth an estimated $68.5 million, and seized a dozen firearms:</p>

<p>The UCETF actively coordinates with federal, state, local and tribal agencies to disrupt the illegal cannabis market. Co-chaired by DCC and CDFW and coordinated by the Homeland Security Division of the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES), the taskforce is bringing together more than two dozen state, local, tribal, and federal partners to protect communities, consumers, and the environment.
