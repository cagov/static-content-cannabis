<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Logging in</h2>

<p>The process for logging in to the Accela CLEaR system will not change.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Log in to the system via the existing link: <a href="https://online.bcc.ca.gov/bcc/Default.aspx">online.bcc.ca.gov/bcc/Default.aspx &nbsp;</a></p>

<p>Enter your existing username and password. If you do not remember your password you can use the self-service password reset process.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">My records</h2>

<p>To view an existing manufacturing license or application converted from PEGA you can select the ‘My Records’ function. You may see an Announcement related to the move of manufacturing licenses from the PEGA system to the CLEaR system. You can mark the Announcement as ‘read’ and clear it.</p>

<p>The ‘My Records’ screen has two sections to display all licenses and applications associated to a user’s account.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Applicants and Licenses</h3>

<p>The ‘Applicants and Licenses’ section will the contain the existing non-manufacturing licenses, applications and renewals. This section will also display all Owner Submittal records: the CLEaR-generated Owner Submittals and converted PEGA Owner Submittals. Owner Submittal records associated with a converted record will have a pre-fix of ‘P’ (e.g. P-21027588-OWN).</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Manufacturing</h3>

<p>The ‘Manufacturing’ section of the ‘My Records’ page will contain all non-Owner Submittal records converted from PEGA. Within the ‘Manufacturing’ section you can access the Renewal and Change in Operations functionality.</p>
