<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cultivators will receive a prorated annual license fee for the Modified License Term.

<li>The prorated fee is calculated by dividing the applicable annual license fee by 365 and multiplying that value by the number of days between the date the original and modified renewal date.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Formula-</p>

<p>(Existing Annual Fee / 365)&nbsp; x Number of Days = New Annual Fee</p>

<p>Example-</p>

<p>Small Outdoor license type = $4,820 annual fee</p>

<p>Current Expiration Date = March 1, 2025</p>

<p>Modified Expiration Date = November 1, 2025</p>

<p>Calculation-</p>

<p>($4,820 / 365) x 245 = $3,235.34</p>
