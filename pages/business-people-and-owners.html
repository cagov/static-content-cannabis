<p>Ensuring accuracy of all owners and other people listed in the CLS portal during renewal is a critical step in the process. Review these steps to verify owners and financial interest holders.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Business/People&gt;Owners</h2>

<p>Review the list of owners for the license. If the list of owners is not accurate, the licensee must submit Form <a href="/2024/01/notifications-and-requests-to-modify-a-license/">DCC LIC 27</a>: Notifications and Requests to Modify a License and submit to <a href="mailto:licensechange@cannabis.ca.gov">licensechange@cannabis.ca.gov</a>. Please move forward with the renewal after the form has been emailed.</p>

<p>For more information on this section you can refer to the Owner Submittal Form <a href="/2024/07/form-9101-commercial-cannabis-owner-submittal-form/">DCC 9101</a>. The Department will use the information provided to determine the owner’s qualification for licensure. Failure to provide the requested information will result in processing delays.</p>
