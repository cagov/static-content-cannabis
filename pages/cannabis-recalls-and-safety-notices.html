<p>Recalls are used to remove defective or&nbsp;potentially&nbsp;unsafe&nbsp;products from the market.&nbsp;There are two types of recalls:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Mandatory recalls, which are ordered by DCC</li>

<li>Voluntary recalls, which are conducted by the cannabis business</li>
</ul>

<p>DCC can order a mandatory recall when:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>There is an immediate and serious threat to human life or health, and&nbsp;</li>

<li>Other remedies would cause an unreasonable delay&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>During&nbsp;a mandatory recall, DCC notifies all licensees who have the affected product. We provide guidance about what to do, and we work closely with licensees to take needed action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>A licensee may conduct a voluntary recall for cannabis or a cannabis products that are adulterated or misbranded. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A licensee must notify DCC that the licensee has initiated a voluntary recall. DCC will then work with licensees to ensure appropriate notices are provided and the recalled cannabis and cannabis products are properly handled. </li>

<li>Recalled cannabis and cannabis products may be remediated if approved by the department or must be destroyed. </li>

<li>After receiving notification of a voluntary recall, DCC also posts the information to the list of voluntary recalls on its website to provide information to licensees and consumers.</li>
