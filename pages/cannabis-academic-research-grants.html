<p>As of July 2022, 37 states allow medical-use, and 19 states allow adult-use of cannabis. Despite changes in state policy, cannabis is still classified by the federal government as a Schedule 1 Controlled Substance. This limits research opportunities and our collective understanding of cannabis and its effects.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Funding opportunity</h2>

<p>DCC is seeking proposals for research projects that&nbsp;advance public understanding of cannabis and effects of legalization.&nbsp;Researchers at California public universities are eligible to apply. Up to $20 million in grants will be awarded.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Through this RFP, DCC seeks to:&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Expand academic knowledge of cannabis</li><li>Gain insight into how government policy decisions impact individuals, communities and equity</li><li>Support government officials in fact-based policymaking</li></ul>

<p>It is the Department’s hope that the research resulting from these grants will advance the body of scientific knowledge about cannabis and prove beneficial not only to California policymakers, but also to those across the nation and world.</p>

<h2>Priority research topics</h2>

<p>DCC is prioritizing the funding of research topics that advance California’s understanding of cannabis, address research gaps and inform policymakers.</p>

<p>The prioritized topics would examine:&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>The health of the cannabis industry</li><li>California’s legacy genetics</li><li>Cannabinoids and potency</li><li>Monopolies and unfair competition</li><li>Medicinal use of cannabis&nbsp;</li></ul>

</div>

<p>These topics support areas of key importance for ensuring a balanced and successful implementation of cannabis legalization – from economic vitality to public health to preservation of the state’s cannabis heritage.</p>

<p>DCC will consider for funding all research proposals that address topics that fall within the scope of Revenue and Taxation section 34019 to further public understanding of the effects of cannabis legalization.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>About this funding</h2>

<p>Proposition 64, the ballot initiative passed in 2016, created cannabis-specific taxes. A portion of these cannabis tax revenues are used to fund public health, environmental, criminal justice and research initiatives. $10 million is designated annually for California public universities to research and evaluate impacts of cannabis legalization.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2020, the Bureau of Cannabis Control awarded nearly $30,000,000 for 34 research projects. Learn more about&nbsp;<a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/about-us/scientific-research/">previously-funded projects</a>.</p>
