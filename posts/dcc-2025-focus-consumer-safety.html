<p><strong>SACRAMENTO – </strong>In the first quarter of 2025 (January 1 – March 31), the Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) continued advancing a safe, sustainable, and well-regulated cannabis market through actions that prioritize consumer safety, expand access to the legal market, and aggressively target unlicensed operations.</p>

<p>The Department continued to focus its law enforcement efforts on disrupting the illegal market. These efforts resulted in:</p>

<li><strong>$151,752,966</strong> worth of illegal cannabis seized</li>

</ul>

<p>Transitioning businesses from provisional to annual licensure and issuing new licenses are key actions that continue to help stabilize the industry and expand access to California’s legal cannabis market. In the first quarter of 2025, the Department transitioned 592 provisional licenses to annual status, almost one-third of those (187) were in Mendocino County. Additionally, 247 new licenses were issued across the following licensing categories:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>155</strong> cultivation licenses</li>

<li><strong>31</strong> retail licenses</li>

<li><strong>22</strong> distribution licenses</li>

<li><strong>14</strong> microbusiness licenses</li>

<li><strong>10</strong> retail non-storefront licenses</li>

<li><strong>3</strong> transport only distributor licenses</li>

<li><strong>1</strong> event organizer license</li>

<li><strong>1</strong> testing laboratory license</li>
</ul>

<p>“The sum of these effort underscores the Department’s ongoing commitment to building a safe and legal cannabis market – one that shuts down the illegal operators, lifts up responsible businesses, expands opportunity, and puts the health and safety of our communities first,” said Department of Cannabis Control Director Nicole Elliott.</p>

<p>The Department continued efforts to strengthen consumer confidence and protect public health by preventing tens of thousands of potentially unsafe cannabis products from reaching the market. Through proactive enforcement, embargoes and recalls, the Department addressed product safety risks, including pesticide contamination, noncompliant labeling practices, incomplete regulatory testing, and inaccurate cannabinoid content claims. In total, 25 recalls were issued, covering 219 products, including 24 voluntary recalls and 1 mandatory recall, reinforcing the Department’s commitment to a safe and accountable legal cannabis industry.</p>

<p>These actions include:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>162 </strong>products recalled due to incomplete regulatory compliance testing</li>

<li><strong>20</strong> products recalled on March 25, for labels that were attractive to children</li>

<li><strong>24 </strong>voluntary recalls and 1 mandatory recall</li>
</ul>

<p>The Department also continued efforts to reinforce the integrity of the legal cannabis market by taking 46 administrative actions. These corrective actions serve to strengthen the licensed market’s legitimacy and ensure businesses operate in accordance with regulatory and public expectations.</p>

<p>The actions include:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>19</strong> license revocations</li>

<li><strong>9</strong> suspensions</li>

<li><strong>23</strong> citations with fines</li>
</ul>

<p>“As we approach our fourth anniversary, we are not letting up – expanding access, leveling the playing field for all businesses, and holding bad actors accountable. Through the application of rigorous product safety standards and strong enforcement, we are protecting market integrity, earning public trust, and making sure California’s legal cannabis industry continues to lead the nation,” stated Elliott.</p>
