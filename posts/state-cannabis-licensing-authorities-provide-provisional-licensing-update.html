<p>The Bureau of Cannabis Control, California Department of Public Health, and California Department of Food and Agriculture are taking steps to prevent gaps in licensure when active temporary commercial cannabis licenses expire. Each licensing authority is tracking expiration dates of temporary licenses and intends to issue a provisional license to qualified temporary license holders before their current temporary license expires. To qualify for a provisional license, an applicant must:</p>
<p>(1) Hold or have held a temporary license for the same premises and the same commercial cannabis activity for which the provisional license will be issued; and</p>
<p>(2) Have submitted a completed license application to the licensing authority, which must include a document or statement indicating that California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) compliance is underway.</p>
<p>If you are contacted by your state licensing authority for additional information, please respond promptly so that processing of a provisional license is not delayed.</p>
<p>Please note that a completed application for purposes of obtaining a provisional license is not the same as a sufficient application to obtain an annual license. Licensees issued a provisional license are expected to be diligently working toward completing all annual license requirements in order to maintain a provisional license.</p>
<p>Temporary or provisional licensees must meet all statutory and regulatory requirements in order to receive an annual license.</p>
