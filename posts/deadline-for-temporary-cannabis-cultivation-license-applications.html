<p>Hello CalCannabis Cultivation Licensing Stakeholders,</p>
<p>Due to the large number of applications being submitted for temporary cannabis cultivation licenses, the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) hereby notifies prospective applicants that any <a href="http://lists.cdfa.ca.gov/t/81303/107898/1342/3/">application for a temporary license</a> received after December 1, 2018, may NOT be processed in time for us to issue a temporary license before January 1, 2019. After December 31, 2018, the authority for CDFA to issue temporary licenses expires. To provide sufficient processing time, please submit your temporary application to CDFA’s CalCannabis Cultivation Licensing Division <strong>by December 1, 2018</strong>.</p>
<p>To receive an extension of your existing temporary cannabis cultivation license, an <a href="http://lists.cdfa.ca.gov/t/81303/107898/1342/4/">application for an annual license</a> <strong>must be submitted and the application fees paid prior to December 31, 2018. </strong>After that date, the authority for CDFA to extend a temporary license expires. If you do not have all the required documentation for an annual license application or are still in the permitting process with your county or city, please provide an explanation for the absence of any required item and submit the missing information as soon as it is obtained.</p>
<p>Submitting an annual application will allow CDFA to determine whether you qualify for an annual license or a <a href="http://lists.cdfa.ca.gov/t/81303/107898/1444/5/">provisional license</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 26038, a person engaging in commercial cannabis cultivation without a license issued by CDFA shall be subject to civil penalties, and the cannabis may be ordered to be destroyed.</p>
