<p><strong>Status</strong>: Approved March 8, 2022</p>

<p>DCC is proposing to adopt regulations to implement Assembly Bill 1525. The regulations allow licensees to&nbsp;<a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/resources/banking-insurance/">authorize us to share information</a>&nbsp;with financial institutions.</p>

<p>These regulations are currently active as emergency regulations. This action would adopt them more permanently through the regular rulemaking process.</p>
