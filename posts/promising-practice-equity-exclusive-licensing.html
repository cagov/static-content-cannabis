<p>Rabin Woods and Chasom Brown are equity partners at Cannabis House, a retail store in Los Angeles. Their goal &#8211; to create a successful cannabis business and to pave the way for a more equitable and sustainable cannabis industry.</p>

<p>In 1983, Woods was arrested for a cannabis-related offense. Today, he is the majority owner of Cannabis House. Brown brings years of experience both in the cannabis industry and as a retail operator to Cannabis House.</p>

<p><em>“You have to come into it knowing that starting a business is hard and that most businesses fail. You have to make good decisions. You have to be smart with money. You have to have your accounting down, just like in any normal business. Your partner can’t be your adversary. Your partner should be your partner. You should be standing back-to-back fighting together, or you’re doomed.”</em></p>

<p>Jurisdictions like Los Angeles have made equity program participation a requirement for applying for specific license types. This ensures that those harmed by cannabis criminalization have a chance to make it in the regulated market.</p>

<p>Los Angeles began issuing licenses to equity applicants in phases. Equity applicants are verified through Los Angeles’ equity program. One of the benefits of the program is an exclusivity period, allowing equity applicants time to establish a business, find a location, and meet potential investors before applications open to the general public.</p>

<p>In 2022, the Long Beach City Council approved a <a href="http:/longbeach.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5638255&amp;GUID=F7818599-E9AB-4A26-B51D-D08706296A1F__;!!LgI54Rc2WdJtrUDt!HS6iR0TjNC-gZT8OHVoxxNgps58dChArSkXUGmwq2vlQ-MkLwz4EPv9XVlQkaMI_tjyXZhbEzk5ktosEhoiS1w1DpPSeAJvY8Khh$" data-type="link" data-id="http:/longbeach.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5638255&amp;GUID=F7818599-E9AB-4A26-B51D-D08706296A1F__;!!LgI54Rc2WdJtrUDt!HS6iR0TjNC-gZT8OHVoxxNgps58dChArSkXUGmwq2vlQ-MkLwz4EPv9XVlQkaMI_tjyXZhbEzk5ktosEhoiS1w1DpPSeAJvY8Khh$">resolution</a> to allow non-storefront retailer license types in the city and made those delivery licenses exclusive to equity applicants.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“An approval or a license is a seat at the table; all involved need to work together to create an actual business.”</em></p>
<cite><strong> — Chasom Brown, Cannabis House</strong></cite></blockquote>

<p>Equity-exclusive licensing is useful in jurisdictions with a large pool of equity applicants. It helps reduce competition for a cannabis license among equity businesses and between equity and non-equity businesses.</p>

<p>It also provides value to the greater community by offering a chance for those negatively impacted by cannabis criminalization to make it in the cannabis industry.</p>
