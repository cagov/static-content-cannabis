<p>Those who wish to comment on the proposed readoption of these emergency regulations must submit their comment directly to OAL within five calendar days of OAL’s posting of the proposed readoption on their website. The comment period will begin on Friday, May 25, 2018, and end on Wednesday, May 30, 2018. You may submit comments on the proposed readoption to OAL at:</p>
