<p>Responding to Owner Application deficiencies is very similar to the previous process. Any owner receiving a deficiency notification must log into the system with their own, separate account and respond to the deficiency. The related Owner Application has a status of Additional Information Needed, and the deficiency Amendment is listed below that.</p>

<p>Any deficiencies found in the Owner application are listed in the first section. To respond, click the checkbox next to the deficiency and then Edit Selected, or choose Actions/Edit. One of the most common deficiencies is for the Electronic Fingerprint Application, shown here. There may be other deficiencies, including government ID or information related to convictions.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Note: As discussed earlier, any Owner Application deficiency also triggers a deficiency notice on the main application. The DRP must respond to that deficiency notice as well before the license can be issued.</p>
