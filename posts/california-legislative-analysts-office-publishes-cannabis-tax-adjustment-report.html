<p>The California Legislative Analyst&#8217;s Office (LAO) recently published their cannabis tax report, <a href="https://lao.ca.gov/reports/2019/4125/cannabis-taxes-121719.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adjusting California&#8217;s Cannabis Taxes</a>, recommending adjustments to the state’s cannabis tax rate.</p>
<p>In November 2016, California voters approved Proposition 64, which legalized the non-medicinal use of cannabis (typically called recreational or adult-use) and created a structure for regulating and taxing it. Proposition 64 also directed LAO to submit a report to the Legislature by January 1, 2020, with recommendations for adjustments to the state’s tax rate on cannabis to achieve three goals: undercutting illicit market prices, ensuring sufficient revenues are generated to fund the types of programs designated in the measure, and discouraging use by persons younger than 21 years of age.</p>
<p>This report responds to that requirement. Specifically, we provide (1) background information on cannabis and its legalization in California, (2) a discussion of the effects of adjusting the tax rate, (3) an assessment of other potential changes to California’s cannabis tax structure, and (4) recommendations for the Legislature.</p>
<p>The full report can be found on LAO&#8217;s website: <a href="https://lao.ca.gov/reports/2019/4125/cannabis-taxes-121719.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://lao.ca.gov/reports/2019/4125/cannabis-taxes-121719.pdf</a>.</p>
