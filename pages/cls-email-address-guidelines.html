<p>Each person is uniquely identified by a name and an email address in the licensing system. Follow these email guidelines to ensure that email addresses are correctly associated with your account. </p>

<!--more-->

<ul>
<li>Do use the same email address for each person – one person, one email address.</li>

<li>Do pay attention to punctuation. Name fields are sensitive, so enter upper and lower case letters consistently. Do not use all caps or all lowercase letters.</li>

<li>When creating an account, there are two places to enter your email address. Do make sure you enter the same email address in both email fields when creating an account.</li>

<li>Do use a separate email address for each owner. All owners must have separate email addresses – one person, one email address – even for partners, married couples, or people in the same household.</li>

<li>Do not use parentheses or other special characters in name fields (apostrophes, hyphens and periods are acceptable).</li>
</ul>
