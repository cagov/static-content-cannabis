<p>There are two types of fees for cannabis licenses:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Application fees &#8211; due when you submit your application. Your application is reviewed after the Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) receives your application fee.</li>

<li>License fees &#8211; due when your application is approved. DCC issues your license after you pay the license fee. The license fee is also due each year, when you renew the license.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fees are specific to the license type for which you are applying for or renewing. Licensing fees, except for cultivators and event organizers, are calculated based on your business’s gross annual revenue. Gross annual revenue is your license’s total income for the 12-month licensing period before you deduct any expenses. Failure to report accurate gross revenue may be grounds for discipline. If you pay less than the required amount, DCC may require you to pay the balance of the appropriate fee plus a penalty of 50 percent of the correct licensing fee.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How fee amounts were set</h2>

<p>State law requires the cannabis fees to:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cover DCC’s costs to provide oversight for the industry</li>

<li>Be scaled so that larger businesses pay more</li>
</ul>

<p>The application and license fees are based on the findings of economists who studied the cannabis industry in California and recommended fee amounts.</p>
