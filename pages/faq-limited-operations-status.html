		<summary>How will making a one or more cultivation license changes affect my provisional license?</summary>
		<div class="accordion-body">

<p>Please be aware provisional cultivation licenses cannot be renewed after January 1, 2025. Provisional cultivation licensees must continue to actively and diligently pursue the requirements for annual licensure. A provisional cultivation licensee may pursue annual licensure for either the original cultivation license or a reduced-size cultivation license. After issuance of an annual cultivation license, that license shall be considered the cultivation licensee’s original cultivation license for the purposes of future requests to reduce canopy size.<br>Given that provisional licenses will no longer be valid after January 1, 2026, the availability of certain options will depend on the expiration date of the license. If you have questions about how license changes affect provisional licenses, please contact <a href="mailto:info@cannabis.ca.gov">info@cannabis.ca.gov</a>. </p>
