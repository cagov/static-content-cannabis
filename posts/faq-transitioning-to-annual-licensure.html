<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Frequently asked questions</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Q: What happens when a provisional licensee does not comply with the law or fails to actively and diligently pursue annual licensure?</h3>

<p>A: When DCC has information that a provisional licensee has failed to comply with the law, or failed to actively and diligently pursue annual licensure, it may suspend, revoke, or deny renewal of the provisional license. If DCC is considering suspending, revoking, or denying renewal of a provisional license, a Notice of Provisional License Review (Notice) will be issued. The Notice will identify violations or outstanding information and the way compliance may be achieved. The Notice will also provide the provisional licensee with instructions on requesting an informal meeting with DCC to discuss the matter.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Q: What happens at an informal meeting?</h3>

<p>A: An informal meeting is an opportunity for the provisional licensee to make verbal statements regarding the matter to DCC. During an informal meeting the provisional licensee, or their authorized representative, may provide DCC with any information they have related to the observed violations or outstanding information. Provisional licensees may submit information for consideration without an informal meeting. Following the timeframe provided in the Notice, DCC will send a written determination.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Q: How can a provisional licensee avoid receiving a Notice of Provisional License Review?  </h3>

<p>A: Provisional licensees should do the following:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Respond to DCC notifications by submitting the required information or documents within the timeframes provided.</li>

<li>Pay outstanding fees in full.</li>

<li>Resolve compliance matters within the timeframes provided.</li>
</ul>
