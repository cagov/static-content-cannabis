<p>The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) has filed an action with the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) to readopt emergency regulations that consolidate the commercial cannabis regulations. <strong>This readoption would allow emergency regulations to remain in place while DCC completes the regular rulemaking process, which began on Friday, March 4.</strong><br><br>DCC’s filing marks the start of the five-calendar day public comment period and the 10-day OAL review period.</p>
