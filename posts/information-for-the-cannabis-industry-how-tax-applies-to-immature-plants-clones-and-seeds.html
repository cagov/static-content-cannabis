However, a distributor is required to transport the cannabis from the nursery to the licensee <em>and</em> when the immature plants, clones, or seeds are sold or transported to a retailer, the distributor is also required to collect the 15 percent cannabis excise tax from the retailer based on the average market price of the immature plants, clones, or seeds. The retailer is responsible for collecting the cannabis excise tax from their retail customers when the immature plants, clones, or seeds are sold at retail.</p>
