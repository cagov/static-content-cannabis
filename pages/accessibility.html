<h2 class="wp-block-heading">About this certification</h2>

<p>The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) publishes its Website Accessibility Certification on this page to provide transparency and ensure the public can easily access our certification record. This replaces our previous PDF-based certification process and aligns with how other state agencies share their accessibility commitments.</p>

<p>This page will be updated every two years as part of the state’s bi-annual certification requirement. Past certifications will be archived and available for reference.</p>
