<p>The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) intends to prepare an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the Licensing of Commercial Cannabis Cultivation in Mendocino County Project (Project). DCC and Mendocino County have worked in partnership to support provisional cultivation licensees’ transition to annual licensure within the County.
