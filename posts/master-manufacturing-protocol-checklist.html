<p>The Master Manufacturing Protocol is a written document that describes how to make a cannabis product. It lists the type and amount of each ingredient to use and each step that must be followed to safely and consistently produce the product. </p>

<p>This protocol helps reduce adulteration risk by preventing incorrect or unintended ingredients from being incorporated into a batch. It includes steps to mitigate the hazards identified in the manufacturing licensee’s Product Quality Plan. It also ensures uniformity among all batches produced by the licensed manufacturer.</p>
