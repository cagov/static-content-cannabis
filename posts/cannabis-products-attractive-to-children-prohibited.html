<p>The Medical and Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA) established regulations and product safety standards for medicinal cannabis use and cannabis use by adults 21 years of age and older.&nbsp; MAUCRSA prohibits cannabis advertising, marketing, products, packaging, and labeling that are attractive to children or persons younger than 21.</p>

<p>Licensees who engage in advertising, marketing, manufacturing, packaging, or labeling cannabis or cannabis products in a manner that is determined to be attractive to children may be subject to citations and fines, license suspension, license denial, and license revocation. Any cannabis or cannabis product that the Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) determines is attractive to children may be subject to compliance action, including embargo or recall.</p>

<p>DCC evaluates cannabis products, advertising, marketing, packaging, and labeling that could be attractive to children on a case-by-case basis but does not provide review or pre-approval of cannabis products, advertising, marketing, packaging, or labeling designs. Licensees are responsible for meeting regulatory and statutory requirements and maintaining compliance.</p>

<p>By following the California Code of Regulations (CCR) and best practices, licensees can ensure regulatory compliance and protect public safety while reducing risk to children. DCC provides additional context to help licensees navigate regulations and safeguard children or persons younger than 21.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best practices for cannabis products, advertising, marketing, packaging, and labeling.</h2>

<p>Specific elements of cannabis products, advertising, marketing, packaging, and labeling may be particularly attractive to children. Edibles present a heightened concern because they often resemble familiar foods, candies, or snacks. Enticing packaging can lead to unintentional consumption for children under five who cannot read.</p>

<p>The following may increase the likelihood that cannabis and cannabis products are attractive to children or enticing to children under five:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Candy-like shapes</li>

<li>Bright colors, holographic finishes, or flashy designs</li>

<li>Packaging imitating non-cannabis snacks</li>

<li>Mascots, anthropomorphized animals, or fictional characters</li>

<li>Flavor names emphasizing sweetness or novelty (e.g., Candy Blast)</li>

<li>Imagery suggesting luxury lifestyles, parties, or group enjoyment</li>

<li>Links to youth-focused social media via QR codes or branding</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Compliance dos and don’ts</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Don’t advertise or market cannabis or cannabis products to individuals under 21 years of age.</h3>

<p>Cannabis and cannabis products cannot be advertised or marketed to individuals under 21 years of age.&nbsp; Any advertising or marketing placed in broadcast, cable, radio, print, and digital communications can only be displayed where at least 71.6 percent of the audience is reasonably expected to be 21 years of age or older, as determined by reliable, up-to-date audience composition data.</p>

<p>Any advertising or marketing involving direct, individualized communication or dialogue controlled by the licensee must utilize a method of age affirmation to verify that the recipient is 21 years of age or older before engaging in that communication or dialogue. Appropriate methods of age affirmation include user confirmation, birth date disclosure, or other similar registration methods.</p>
