<p>This section provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for agreeing to the required declarations and uploading any necessary documents for your CLEaR manufacturing renewal. If you indicated changes to your operational activities earlier in the renewal process, you will be directed to select the new activities before proceeding. You will also need to upload supporting documents, including those verifying your total gross revenue for the current license period and any relevant Labor Peace Agreement documentation. Follow the guide carefully to ensure all requirements are met for a successful renewal.</p>
