<p>There are two types of fees for cannabis licenses:</p>

<ul>
<li>Application fees &#8211; due when you submit your application. Your application is reviewed after the Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) receives your application fee.</li>

<li>License fees &#8211; due when your application is approved. DCC issues your license after you pay the license fee. The license fee is also due each year, when you renew the license.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fees are specific to the license type you are applying for or renewing. Most fees are calculated based on your business’s gross annual revenue. Gross annual revenue is all the money received for activities conducted under the license before subtracting expenses.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How fee amounts were set</h2>

<p>State law requires the cannabis fees to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cover DCC’s costs to provide oversight for the industry</li>

<li>Be scaled so that larger businesses pay more</li>
</ul>

<p>The application and license fees are based on the findings of economists who studied the cannabis industry in California and recommended fee amounts.</p>
