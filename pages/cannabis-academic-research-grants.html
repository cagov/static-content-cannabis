<p>As of July 2022, 37 states allow medical-use, and 19 states allow adult-use of cannabis. Despite changes in state policy, cannabis is still classified by the federal government as a Schedule 1 Controlled Substance. This limits research opportunities and our collective understanding of cannabis and its effects.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Funding opportunity</h2>

<p>DCC is seeking proposals for research projects that&nbsp;advance public understanding of cannabis and effects of legalization.&nbsp;Researchers at California public universities are eligible to apply. Up to $20 million in grants will be awarded.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Through this RFP, DCC seeks to:&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Expand academic knowledge of cannabis</li><li>Gain insight into how government policy decisions impact individuals, communities and equity</li><li>Support government officials in fact-based policymaking</li></ul>

<p>It is the Department’s hope that the research resulting from these grants will advance the body of scientific knowledge about cannabis and prove beneficial not only to California policymakers, but also to those across the nation and world.</p>

<h2>Priority research topics</h2>

<p>DCC is prioritizing the funding of research topics that advance California’s understanding of cannabis, address research gaps and inform policymakers.</p>

<p>The prioritized topics would examine:&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>The health of the cannabis industry</li><li>California’s legacy genetics</li><li>Cannabinoids and potency</li><li>Monopolies and unfair competition</li><li>Medicinal use of cannabis&nbsp;</li></ul>

<h2>About this funding</h2>

<p>Proposition 64, the ballot initiative passed in 2016, created cannabis-specific taxes. A portion of these cannabis tax revenues are used to fund public health, environmental, criminal justice and research initiatives. $10 million is designated annually for California public universities to research and evaluate impacts of cannabis legalization.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2020, the Bureau of Cannabis Control awarded nearly $30,000,000 for 34 research projects. Learn more about&nbsp;<a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/about-us/scientific-research/">previously-funded projects</a>.</p>

<h2>Questions and answers</h2>
<cagov-accordion>
	<details>
		<summary>Eligibility</summary>
		<div class="accordion-body">

<p><strong>Who is eligible to apply for the Cannabis Academic Research Grant?</strong></p>

<p>Applicants are limited to California public universities (the Universities of California and California State Universities), per Revenue and Taxation Code <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=RTC&amp;sectionNum=34019.">§34019(b)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>We are a non-profit organization working with a University of California (UC) school. Are we eligible for funding? </strong></p>

<p>Only California public universities are eligible to apply for and receive funding. However, nonprofits and other organizations can support research as subawardees.</p>

<p><strong>Will DCC consider expanding eligibility to additional entities, such as testing laboratories or universities located outside of California?</strong></p>

<p>DCC does not have the authority to expand applicant eligibility. Under California Revenue and Taxation Code <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=RTC&amp;sectionNum=34019.">§34019(b)</a>, the only eligible recipients of this grant funding are California public universities.</p>

<p><strong>Who is eligible to serve as Principal Investigator (PI) or Co-PI? Are postdoctoral fellows eligible for grant funding?</strong> </p>

<p>The grant funding contract is executed between DCC and the university, and applicants must submit an Institutional Cover Letter to demonstrate the university’s approval of the proposed research. Contact your affiliated university to determine if you would be eligible to serve as a PI.</p>

<p><strong>Can an individual serve as a PI for more than one proposal or awarded project? Can individuals participate in multiple research projects (as co-PI, collaborator, or consultant)?</strong></p>

<p>DCC has not set any restriction that would prevent a researcher’s participation in more than one project.</p>

<p><strong>Can an individual submit multiple proposals?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, applicants can submit more than one proposal. The research proposals must describe different projects, but the projects can be related or address different aspects of single priority research topic. </p>

<p><strong>Are researchers with projects currently funded by DCC eligible for funding of a new proposal?</strong></p>

<p>Researchers who have active grants with DCC are not prohibited from applying for this round of funding.</p>

<p><strong>Can more than one California public university apply for and administer the grant for a single collaborative project?</strong></p>

<p>DCC encourages collaboration between multiple universities. However, one university will need to serve as the designated applicant and, if awarded, would be considered the grantee for purposes of signing the grant agreement, receiving the disbursement of funds, and to ensure compliance with the grant agreement. </p>

		<summary>Eligible research topics</summary>
		<div class="accordion-body">

<p><strong>What topics are eligible for grant funding?</strong></p>

<p>Any research that studies cannabis and the impacts of cannabis legalization is eligible for grant funding and will be considered.</p>

<p>California Revenue and Taxation Code <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=RTC&amp;sectionNum=34019.">§34019(b)</a> defines eligible topics and includes examples. Within this scope of eligible topics, DCC has also identified <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/research-grant_2022_priority_research_topics.pdf">priority research topics</a> to assist researchers eager to help state cannabis leaders close gaps in knowledge in important and timely policy areas.</p>

<p><strong>Will DCC consider proposals for projects that build upon previously-funded research?</strong></p>

<p>DCC will consider proposals that will further expand knowledge and understanding of a previously-funded or ongoing research project. In order to be competitive, the proposal must describe how the proposed project will further expand upon the research already conducted.</p>

<p><strong>Will DCC consider a proposal for a secondary analysis of a previously-funded project?</strong></p>

<p>DCC will consider proposals for secondary analysis. In order to be competitive, the proposal should describe the secondary analysis in detail, how it is different from the initial analysis, and how the additional analysis will advance scientific knowledge of cannabis.</p>

<p><strong>Can you assess our proposed research topic and provide feedback about DCC’s level of interest?</strong></p>

<p>DCC will consider any proposal for research related to cannabis and impacts of cannabis legalization. Each proposal will be assessed on its own merits, utilizing the criteria outlined on pages 13-14 of the <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/research-grant_2022_rfp.pdf">RFP</a>. DCC cannot provide feedback outside of the application review process.</p>

<p><strong>Are active (in process) research projects eligible for grant funding? What if the project has federal grant money?</strong></p>

<p>There is no restriction that would prevent DCC from funding pre-existing or federally-funded projects. In order to be competitive, the grant proposal should describe in detail the additional work that would be done using the additional funding and how the inclusion of the additional funding will advance scientific knowledge of cannabis.</p>

		<summary>Priority research topics</summary>
		<div class="accordion-body">

<p><strong>Why is DCC identifying priority research topics, and how were these topics chosen?</strong></p>

<p>DCC published the <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/research-grant_2022_priority_research_topics.pdf">priority research topics</a>, in part, because public university administrators expressed a desire for guidance about what specific areas of scientific study would be most helpful to the State given there are so many unexplored areas of research related to cannabis.</p>

<p>These priority topics do not replace the broader set of eligible topics identified in Revenue and Taxation Code <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=RTC&amp;sectionNum=34019.">§34019(b)</a>. Instead, the identification of research priorities provides additional direction to prospective grantees eager to help state cannabis leaders close gaps in knowledge in important and timely policy areas. These topics support areas of key importance for informing a balanced and successful implementation of cannabis legalization – from public health to economic vitality to preservation of the state’s cannabis heritage.</p>

<p>The priority research topics were developed with input from the various state departments and agencies that also have roles in cannabis oversight and were informed by public health experts, environmental scientists, and others.</p>

<p><strong>Will proposals that do not fall into the priority research topics be considered?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. DCC will consider any proposal for research related to cannabis and impacts of cannabis legalization.</p>

<p><strong>Will proposals that include some, but not all, of the priority research topics be considered?</strong></p>

<p>DCC is seeking a single research team for the “Health of the Cannabis Industry” priority topic. For other identified priority research topics, proposals that address only a portion of the research topic will be considered. However, topics such as California Legacy Genetics would benefit from engagement by multi-disciplinary researchers.</p>

<p>DCC strongly encourages applicants to consider assembling collaborative research teams that can comprehensively address the priority research topic. If a university is comprised of multiple researchers who each seek to address different components of the project, the proposal would be strengthened if the researchers submitted a unified proposal and plan for coordinated work.</p>

<p><strong>Can multiple investigators from the same institution submit applications for the same priority research topic?</strong></p>

<p>DCC anticipates that multiple submissions for each priority research topic will be submitted. There is no restriction on multiple submissions from the same university, either as stand-alone proposals or submitted in coordination. However, due to the limited amount of funding available, it is likely that not every project will receive funding.</p>

<p><strong>California Legacy Genetics &amp; Genetic Sequencing: Can the grant application deadline be extended to allow additional time for the development of a culturally-sensitive outreach and engagement plan?</strong></p>

<p>The outreach plan is not required to be submitted at the time of application. Proposals submitted in response to the California Legacy Genetics topic must describe how the culturally-sensitive outreach plan will be developed.</p>

<p><strong>Medicinal Use of Cannabis: How is “qualified patient” defined?</strong></p>

<p>“Qualified Patient” includes both patients who have received a Medical Marijuana Identification Card issued by the California Department of Public Health, as well as those who have received a doctor’s recommendation to use cannabis for medical purposes.</p>
