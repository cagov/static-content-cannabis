Complete any permitting requirements your city or county requires before you apply for a state cannabis license.</span></li>

<li><strong>Learn the state regulations for cannabis businesses</strong><br><span style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-black-color">The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) has <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/cannabis-laws/laws-and-regulations/">requirements</a> for standard operating procedures, training employees and how facilities must be set up. Make sure you understand and can meet these rules.</span></li>

<li><strong>Gather your application information and documents</strong><br><span style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-black-color">DCC has <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/applicants/application-resources/" data-type="page" data-id="698">resources</a> to help you create the documents you need during the license process.

<li><strong>Complete your application</strong><br><span style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-black-color">Fill in the required fields in the licensing system and upload any needed documents.

When you finish your application, sign and submit it.</span></li>

<li><strong>Pay your application fee and submit your application</strong><br><span style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-black-color">When you finish your license application, the system will tell you how to pay your <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/applicants/application-license-fees/" data-type="page" data-id="721">application fee</a>.

You can pay your fee through the licensing system via bank account/check, money order or credit card. You can also pay in cash by setting up an appointment to visit our office in person. For security purposes, no cash payments can be accepted without an appointment. Your license will be issued once we receive your payment.</span></li>

<li><strong>Post your license</strong><br><span style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-black-color">DCC licenses are good for one year.
