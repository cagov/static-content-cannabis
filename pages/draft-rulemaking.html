<h3>DCC Conflict of Interest Code </h3>

<p><strong>Type</strong>: Special rulemaking</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Under review</p>

<p>California law requires all state and local government agencies to establish and follow a Conflict of Interest Code. These codes require agency officials who routinely participate in decisions to publicly disclose personal financial information. They designate: </p>

<ul><li>Which employee positions must file a Form 700 Statement of Economic Interests </li><li>The financial interests that those employees must disclose</li></ul>

<p>DCC is proposing to adopt a Conflict of Interest Code. </p>

<p>The Political Reform Act prohibits public officials and employees from using their official positions to influence governmental decisions in which they have financial interests. A Conflict of Interest Code helps identify and disclose potential conflicts of interest. Learn more about the Political Reform Act on the <a href="https://www.fppc.ca.gov/learn/rules-on-conflict-of-interest-codes.html#:~:text=Why%20Government%20Agencies%20Must%20Adopt%20a%20Conflict%20of%20Interest%20Code&amp;text=To%20help%20identify%20potential%20conflicts,Economic%20Interests%20(Form%20700).">Fair Political Practices Commission’s website</a>.</p>

<h3>Equity fee waivers</h3>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Approved December 20, 2021</p>

<p>DCC adopted emergency regulations to provide licensing fee waivers to qualified equity businesses statewide.

<h3>Re-titling of cannabis regulations</h3>

<p><strong>Type</strong>: Section 100</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Approved July 14, 2021</p>

<p>The three existing sets of regulations were moved into one title in the California Code of Regulations. The cannabis regulations are now together in Title 4, Division 19. Sections were also renumbered. No changes were made to the requirements in regulation.</p>

<p>This change used a rulemaking action called a Section 100. Section 100 lets agencies make changes to regulations that have no regulatory effect.</p>
