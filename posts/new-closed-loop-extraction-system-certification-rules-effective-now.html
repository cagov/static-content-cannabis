<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overview</h2>

<p>New rules were approved in the November 2022 regulations that require operators of closed-loop extraction systems to have their systems recertified by a California-licensed engineer at least once every five years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This requirement helps ensure the safety and protection of both cannabis industry employees and consumers.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What this means for you</h2>

<p>If you operate a closed-loop extraction system, get re-certified! Lead times can be long for re-certification, so don’t wait – get your equipment recertified now to ensure you don’t fall out of compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>More information regarding this requirement can be found within the California Code of Regulations §17206.1 (Certification of Closed-Loop Systems) of the DCC Regulations.
