<p>CalCannabis Cultivation Licensing, a division of the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA), is preparing to host public workshops this September to provide information and gather feedback from workshop participants on the development of the new CalCannabis Appellations Program.</p>
<p>CalCannabis is responsible for developing a process for licensed cannabis cultivators in California to establish state cannabis appellations. An appellation is a certified designation or title that may signify standards, practices, and the varietal of cannabis grown in a certain geographical area. The term is used most often with “appellation of origin,” which identifies the geographical origin of a product and sometimes how a product was produced.</p>
<p>We would appreciate it if you would take a few minutes to complete the short survey below to help us estimate the number of licensed cultivators who might be interested in attending our public cannabis appellations workshops. Click <a href="http://lists.cdfa.ca.gov/t/77637/107898/1400/3/">here</a> to complete our survey.</p>
<p>Please respond to the survey by Friday, August 10, 2018.</p>
<p>If you have questions, contact the CalCannabis Appellations Program by sending an email to <a href="mailto:CDFA.CalCannabis_Appellations@cdfa.ca.gov">CDFA.CalCannabis_Appellations@cdfa.ca.gov</a>.</p>
