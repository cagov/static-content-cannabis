<p>Dear California Community Reinvestment Grants Program Interested Parties,</p>
<p>The Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz) has concluded an initial round of webinars and community workshops across the state to discuss the California Community Reinvestment Grants Program (CalCRG).  These workshops were beneficial in soliciting input and feedback from interested stakeholders on the details of CalCRG which is vital in assisting GO-Biz staff  with development and implementation of the grant program. We will be accepting any additional feedback until December 14, 2018. GO-Biz will still be available to answer questions after this date. Please send all comments and questions to <a href="mailto:CalCRG@gobiz.ca.gov">CalCRG@gobiz.ca.gov</a>. </p>
<p>GO-Biz anticipates requesting additional stakeholder comments on the draft grant solicitation in early February, soliciting and evaluating grant applications during the spring of 2019, and awarding grants by June 2019.  For additional program information, including a link to the PowerPoint presented at the webinars and community workshops, please visit <a href="http://cts.vresp.com/c/?GOBiz/e61200bdc0/2f75a56266/ce5a085733">www.business.ca.gov/CalCRG</a>.</p>
