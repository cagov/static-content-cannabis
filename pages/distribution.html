<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Testing and quality assurance</h2>

<p>Distributors make sure a licensed testing laboratory tests all batches of cannabis goods before they are sold. Distributors can only transport cannabis goods to a retailer for sale if they pass testing. Goods that fail testing are destroyed or sent to a manufacturer for remediation. Before transporting goods to a retailer, type 11 distributors also conduct a quality assurance review.</p>
