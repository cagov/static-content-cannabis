		<summary>What do the License Statuses mean?</summary>
		<div class="accordion-body">

<p>The Status tells you if the DCC commercial cannabis license is an Active license or not.</p>

<p><strong>Active</strong>&nbsp;means the business has an active license. They may do the commercial cannabis activities allowed by their license type at the location listed on the license.</p>

<p><strong>About to Expire</strong>&nbsp;means the annual/provisional license is within 60 calendar days prior to expiration and the license remains Active.</p>

<p><strong>Expired &#8211; Pending Renewal</strong> means the license is within 30 days after expiration and can still be renewed with an added late fee of fifty percent of the license fee.</p>

<p>The cannabis business cannot do any commercial cannabis activity at the location if they have one of the following statuses:<strong></strong></p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Expired – </strong>The annual/provisional license expired due to non-renewal and is no longer Active. </li>

<li><strong>Not in Operation –</strong> The License was approved for Disaster Relief and is not currently in operation due to the conditions of the regulatory relief provided.</li>

<li><strong>Revoked – </strong>The annual/provisional license has been terminated due to a licensing action and is no longer Active</li>

<li><strong>Surrendered – </strong>The licensee voluntarily relinquished or abandoned their license and the license is no longer Active</li>

<li><strong>Suspended – </strong>The annual/provisional license is undergoing disciplinary action and not Active for a definitive or indefinite amount of time </li>
</ul>
