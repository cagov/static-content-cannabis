<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Equity fee waivers</h2>

<p><strong>Type</strong>: Emergency rulemaking</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Approved December 20, 2021</p>

<p>DCC adopted emergency regulations to provide licensing fee waivers to qualified equity businesses statewide. The waivers are designed to assist individuals harmed by the War on Drugs with starting and operating a cannabis business. The regulations implement the fee waiver provisions of <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001o5gXg2WtWHqT5qP2D0F-nSOXc_NXPFQIKULp13NsCQ1C_jHsdXZj_WgAS66TQs62H9ncwJ61Rxc0skFSH71hIblaF8H3sBeg9wONsLJOq_uXL2ahxhnKN7PQXrFYP3VsvisuPXye-lWLjPHgX9yoIwqkebwBeZ822CKoSoLpMWI-NcWjK91ZpLALJ4UXCDS1RIEjkH3QRB_fP8zXPRMly5H8Sz1gUFKmA9YVj9Y3qF0=&amp;c=2JFV7WHTI-jUDtrqhgYhFmoF6sfJsqV_kC9r2iJFzdZGPFQRVLmdeg==&amp;ch=DnKSFVMrGLPbVCUtCEvzsW4MyonQ_ApglixcGJx5JPoeqeyL-0atlA==__;!!AvL6XA!nAHoDsRO17wp6LlixZiJ6jfpQLnboIyv-G-0ll6icK6EvUDpLDcBBwjCU0-fC-vff__hbKWxjw$">Senate Bill 166</a>. </p>

<p>This statewide program provides financial support to cannabis business by waiving licensing fees if applicants and licensees meet the equity eligibility criteria, such as past cannabis convictions or arrests, reduced income or residence in an area disproportionately impacted by past criminal justice policies, as well as other criteria.</p>

<p>The emergency regulations add specificity to eligibility criteria established through SB 166 and establish a process for equity applicants and licensees to request waivers for licensing fees.</p>
