<p><em>The DCC adopted regulations requiring the use of its standard cannabinoids test method and standardized operating procedures for dried flower by state licensed testing laboratories.</em></p>

<p>CALIFORNIA –&nbsp;Beginning January 1, 2024, state licensed laboratories are required to use the Department of Cannabis Control’s (DCC) standard cannabinoids test method and standardized operating procedures for testing dried flower, including non-infused pre-rolls. These new requirements were part of the <a href="/cannabis-laws/rulemaking/standard-cannabinoids-test-method-and-standardized-operating-procedures/">DCC’s regulatory action</a> adopting the test method and standardized operating procedures pursuant to Senate Bill 544. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;All licensed laboratories are mandated to begin using the DCC’s developed method for cannabinoid testing in dried flower, including non-infused pre-rolls, no later than January 1. Prior to utilizing the DCC’s developed test method and standardized operating procedures, each testing laboratory must perform a method verification in their own laboratory demonstrating that they can meet the cannabinoid test method’s performance specifications. The laboratory must generate a verification report and submit it to the DCC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When arranging for regulatory compliance testing on dried flower or pre-roll batches, licensed distributors should reference the list of licensed laboratories that have properly completed the method verification and DCC review process to being using the DCC developed method</p>

<p>View the list of licensed laboratories below that have properly completed the method verification and DCC review process to begin using the DCC developed test method. </p>

<p>If a licensed laboratory is not listed above, this means they have not completed the Department’s review process and they are not able to test dried flower and non-infused pre-rolls until the process is completed. As additional laboratories complete this process, the Department will update this list.</p>
