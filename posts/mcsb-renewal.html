<h2 class="wp-block-heading">An active license is required to conduct commercial cannabis activity</h2>

<p>California state law requires all those conducting commercial cannabis activity to have an active state license. If you submit your renewal application before your expiration date, your license will remain active while your renewal application is reviewed. If your expiration date passes and you have not submitted your renewal application, you will be required to cease operations and you will be prohibited from conducting any commercial cannabis activity until you have an active license.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Not renewing?</h2>

<p>If you do not want to renew your license, please contact our licensing team to notify us of your decision before the license expiration date. If you have any questions about renewing your license, please contact the licensing analyst assigned to your account or reach out to our licensing team.</p>
