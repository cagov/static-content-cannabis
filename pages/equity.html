<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Effects of cannabis criminalization</h2>

<p>Cannabis prohibition had a devastating impact on Californians and people across the country. The long-term consequences of cannabis criminalization continue to impact:</p>

<ul>
<li>People convicted of a cannabis offense</li>

<li>Their families</li>

<li>The communities in which they live</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Local Equity Promising Practices</h2>

<p>The Department of Cannabis Control is committed to providing equity to communities harmed by cannabis criminalization. We support local communities who share these values by lifting up practices that are making a difference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Through discussions with equity licensees, we are uncovering the most effective and innovative equity policies from jurisdictions throughout the state. By talking to business owners affected by the War on Drugs and asking them what policies have helped them start or grow their business, we are gathering information about what all of us can do to advance our shared commitment to equity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This list of promising practices will help local jurisdictions develop equity resources that fit the needs of their local cannabis businesses. These links will also serve business owners looking for equity programs and can be used by regulators looking for ideas on how to achieve equity goals.</p>

<p>We’re happy to share these stories as we work together to continue supporting local efforts.</p>
