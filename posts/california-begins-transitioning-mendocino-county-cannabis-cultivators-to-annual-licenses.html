<p><strong><em>DCC To Process Nearly 500 Licenses, Supporting Small and Legacy Growers</em></strong></p>

<p>The California Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) this week began transitioning 84 Mendocino County cultivators from provisional to annual licenses, taking a pivotal step to preserve the region’s legacy while strengthening the state’s regulated cannabis market. Following last month’s certification of the Mendocino County Environmental Impact Report, these licensees represent the first of nearly 500 licenses in the county slated to transition over the next year.  </p>

<p>“Mendocino County’s heritage as a cornerstone of California’s cannabis industry is invaluable and we deeply appreciate the commitment of these cultivators to operate in the legal market,” said Nicole Elliott, Director of the Department of Cannabis Control. “This transition demonstrates that our cannabis market can be inclusive, equitable, and reflective of the state’s rich history.&#8221;</p>

<p>The initial licensees are part of nearly 500 provisional cultivation licensees in Mendocino County slated for transition over the next year. As provisional licenses phase out in 2025, this effort reflects the DCC’s broader commitment to streamline processes, offer technical support, and reduce barriers for licenses while safeguarding California’s rich cultural legacy of cannabis cultivation and ensuring consumer safety and environmental stewardship.</p>
