<p>DCC and Mendocino County have worked in partnership to support provisional cultivation licensees’ transition to annual licensure within the County. The Licensing of Commercial Cannabis in Mendocino County Project (Project) consists of the DCC actions to approve annual licensing of such commercial cannabis cultivation operations in Mendocino County under California Code of Regulations, title 4, section 15002. The EIR will programmatically evaluate the environmental impacts of the DCC’s annual licensing of commercial cannabis cultivation operations in the county as well as the environmental impacts of future licensed commercial cannabis cultivation operations.</p>

<p>DCC, which is responsible for the issuance of state commercial cannabis cultivation licenses, will be lead agency in accordance with CEQA in connection with the issuance of such licenses in Mendocino County.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As specified by the CEQA Guidelines, a Notice of Preparation (NOP) will be circulated for public review and comment for a 30-day review period. The comment period starts on <strong>August 2, 2023,</strong> and ends on <strong>August 31, 2023</strong>.</p>

<p>DCC will also hold a virtual scoping meeting on <strong>Tuesday, August 22, 2023 – 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. </strong>Attendees may participate via WebEx online meeting platform or telephone conferencing. </p>
