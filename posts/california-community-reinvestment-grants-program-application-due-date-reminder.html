<p>Dear California Community Reinvestment Grants Program Interested Parties:</p>
<p>As a reminder, the deadline to submit a California Community Reinvestment Grants (CalCRG) program application is <strong>11:59 p.m.</strong> (Pacific Time) on <strong>Thursday, May 16, 2019</strong>.</p>
<p>Applicants are encouraged to review the Grant Solicitation, FAQs, and other technical assistance documents prior to submitting an application.  <strong>Please ensure that only CalCRG application templates for the Budget Spreadsheet and Work Plan/Timeline are used and uploaded to the application.</strong>  These documents and resources can be accessed at: <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__cts.vresp.com_c_-3FGOBiz_7fcdef8bf6_2f75a56266_f526ba2a05&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=LHIwbLRMLqgNuqr1uGLfTA&amp;r=0VVin0diWSJhySQTljbmjmH7obUZIPhx4sxv503be1I&amp;m=WCetPG8m9054N39m50P9c0dx7NJ69pFjh795jqYSaNw&amp;s=5u9lpLN1dvDXAzkbHdqO8aPqIak842OS66LvhxGiUL4&amp;e=">http://www.business.ca.gov/CalCRG</a>. </p>
<p>Applicants needing assistance with an application may call the CalCRG hotline (916-322-2683) or email <a href="mailto:CalCRG@gobiz.ca.gov">CalCRG@gobiz.ca.gov</a>.  CalCRG staff will be available until 6:30 p.m. on the due date.</p>
<p>GO-Biz plans on releasing the next CalCRG Grant Solicitation in early 2020.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The CalCRG program is intended to support communities disproportionately affected by past federal and state drug policies, also known as the War on Drugs.  The applicant must describe how the populations and/or community they are proposing to serve have been impacted by the War on Drugs, however, the populations are not limited to those that were formerly incarcerated in jail or prison unless the applicant is proposing services in the “legal services to address barriers to reentry” funding category.  Additionally, in some instances preference points may be allocated to organizations that, within the last 12 months, have served clients that have been formerly incarcerated in prison.  Clients that have been in jail instead of prison do not qualify for this preference points allocation category<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>GO-Biz will only review applications that are successfully submitted.  Applications can only be submitted after all sections of the application are marked complete.  From there the applicant will need to click the &#8220;submit&#8221; button which will open up a screen where the applicant will need to agree to conditions and click “Submit Application.”  Once this is done, the applicant will receive an email receipt confirming that the application was successfully submitted.  If the applicant does not receive this confirmation after clicking the “Submit Application” button, please wait a few minutes and check spam folders and security filters.  The applicant can also verify that an application has been submitted by clicking on “My Applications” on the CalCRG application home screen.  The application should reflect a submitted status.</p>
