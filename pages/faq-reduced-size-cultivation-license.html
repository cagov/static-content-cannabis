<p>Licensees with an active cultivation license can now request a Reduced-Size Cultivation License either at the time of renewal or when making a one-time change to the cultivation licenseâ€™s expiration date.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Q: How do I know if I qualify?</h2>

<p>To qualify for a Reduced-Size Cultivation License the licensee must:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Submit an updated premises diagram that satisfies regulatory requirements and identifies both the canopy area of the Original Cultivation License and the canopy area of the requested Reduced-Size Cultivation License,&nbsp;</li>

<li>Pay any applicable licensing fee, and&nbsp;</li>

<li>Meet all applicable renewal requirements.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Q: What are the requirements?</h2>

<p>The following requirements apply to Reduced-Size Cultivation Licenses:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>The reduced-size canopy area must be fully located with the canopy area of the Original Cultivation License,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>The Reduced-Size Cultivation License must maintain the same type of lighting as the Original Cultivation License, and&nbsp;</li>

<li>The Reduced-Size Cultivation License must remain at the reduced-size for the duration of the Modified License Term.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>At the time of renewal, the licensee may choose to retain the Reduced-Size Cultivation License, change to a different Reduced-Size Cultivation License, or restore the Original Cultivation License.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Q: <strong>How can I request a Reduced-Size Cultivation License?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Eligible cultivation licenses can request a Reduced-Size Cultivation License during license renewal or when requesting a one-time change to the license expiration date using the Cannabis Licensing System (CLS).&nbsp; </p>

</div>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Q: <strong>How will fees be calculated?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>When reducing the size of a cultivation license at time of renewal, the licensee will be responsible for paying the application fee associated with the Original Cultivation License plus the annual license fee associated with the Reduced-Size Cultivation License selected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>When reducing the size of a cultivation when making a change to the license expiration date, the Cannabis Licensing System (CLS) will first calculate any credit the licensee may be eligible for due to the change in expiration date and then apply the license fee associated with the Reduced-Size Cultivation License selected by the licensee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
