<p>Rabin Woods and Chasom Brown are equity partners at Cannabis House, a retail storefront located in Los Angeles. Rabin was arrested for a cannabis-related offense in 1983 and owns 55% of the business and Chasom has years of experience both in the cannabis industry and as a retail operator. Their goal is to not just create a successful business, but to foster an equity community in Los Angeles and pave the way for a more equitable and sustainable cannabis industry.</p>

<p>To guarantee those negatively impacted by the War on Drugs can participate in the cannabis industry, some jurisdictions have made equity program participation a requirement for applying for specific license types.</p>

<p>Los Angeles began issuing licenses to applicants in phases. Many of these phases limited license applications and specific license types to individuals who have been negatively impacted by the War on Drugs and have been verified through Los Angeles’ equity program. This exclusivity period has allowed those harmed by cannabis criminalization the space to establish a business, find a location, and meet potential investors before applications open to the general public.</p>

<p>In 2022, the Long Beach City Council approved a <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/longbeach.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5638255&amp;GUID=F7818599-E9AB-4A26-B51D-D08706296A1F__;!!LgI54Rc2WdJtrUDt!HS6iR0TjNC-gZT8OHVoxxNgps58dChArSkXUGmwq2vlQ-MkLwz4EPv9XVlQkaMI_tjyXZhbEzk5ktosEhoiS1w1DpPSeAJvY8Khh$">resolution</a> to allow for non-storefront retailer license types in the city and at the same time made those delivery licenses exclusive to equity applicants. In doing so, Long Beach sought to fulfill the promise of recreational legalization to create an industry where those harmed by cannabis criminalization have a chance to make it in the regulated market.</p>

<p>Equity-exclusive license types or equity-exclusive licensing phases create opportunities for equity businesses to participate in the cannabis industry and reduce barriers to entry faced by equity applicants. When equity businesses don’t need to worry about competing with non-equity applicants, they can focus on creating a business that meets their communities needs and prioritizes uplifting those harmed by the War on Drugs.</p>

<pre class="wp-block-verse"><em>“You can take the word cannabis out of it. Treat it like a business. You have to come into it knowing that starting a business is hard and that most businesses fail. You have to make good decisions. You have to be smart with money. You have to have your accounting down. Just like in any normal business. Your partner can’t be your adversary. Your partner should be your partner. You should be standing back-to-back fighting together or you’re doomed.”</em><br><em>– Chasom Brown, Cannabis House</em></pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Equity-exclusive licensing is especially useful in jurisdictions with a larger pool of equity applicants. Equity entrepreneurs that would otherwise have limited opportunities to participate in the regulated cannabis industry are instead prioritized and given more opportunities to create a business. By limiting license types or creating licensing phases exclusive to equity businesses, jurisdictions can reduce competition for a cannabis license among equity businesses and between equity businesses and non-equity businesses. When jurisdictions adopt equity-exclusive licensing policies, they also signal to their pool of applicants that they value a diverse and equitable cannabis business community.&nbsp;Jurisdictions are able to point to a specific policy and say with confidence that space has been made for those negatively impacted by cannabis criminalization to make it in the cannabis industry.</p>
