<p>For over 50 years, federal and state governments have pursued and enforced the failed War on Drugs that has disproportionately impacted communities of color. How we address the challenges created by these policies matter. In California, at both local and state level, regulation of medicinal and adult-use cannabis has often considered how past, current, and future policies impact historically underserved and marginalized communities. This has resulted in support of individuals, business owners, and communities negatively impacted by the War on Drugs. These efforts serve as a reflection of California’s values, and more can be done to focus and improve this work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In recognition of the challenges and opportunities in creating a more equitable framework for cannabis regulation, DCC has developed an Equity Action Plan. This plan focuses on efforts to incorporate equity within DCC and DCC’s efforts to support an equitable, well-regulated cannabis industry throughout California.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mission and Vision&nbsp;</h2>

<p>At DCC, we value an equitable marketplace, and that starts with supporting entrepreneurs seeking to enter the cannabis industry and run a cannabis business in California, having been marginalized by decades of prohibition. DCC is working to build, refine, and invest in the DCC&#8217;s organization and culture—one that includes hiring and retaining staff that reflect the diversity of California, building and maintaining an organization that respects difference, and sharing information with stakeholders in more equitable ways.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Mission</h3>

<p>Through innovative policies and effective implementation, DCC advances and facilitates a well-regulated, legal market that benefits all Californians.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Vision</h3>

<p>California has a safe, sustainable, and equitable cannabis market that serves as an example for the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>DCC’s Equity Action Plan has been designed to align with <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/about-us/about-dcc/#dcc%E2%80%99s-strategic-plan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DCC’s Strategic Plan</a> and organizational goals. The Equity Action Plan focuses on five key organizational priorities:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Developing a diverse workforce;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Adopting equitable regulations;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Developing materials to support compliance within the regulated market;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Supporting licensees with resources to enter and remain in the cannabis market; and&nbsp;</li>

<li>Utilizing new and existing forums to gain feedback from stakeholders.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>DCC remains committed to developing a safe, sustainable, and equitable cannabis market, and the Equity Action Plan is an important part of that work. This plan is a “living document,” requiring flexibility and adaptability as new opportunities emerge and priorities and circumstances change. We look forward to sharing our progress in achieving these goals with stakeholders in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Strategic Priorities&nbsp;</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Organizational priority 1: Diverse workforce&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Develop strategies to assist with recruitment across the divisions to gain a more diverse workforce.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Equity opportunity</h4>

<p>Continue to implement California guidelines for embedding equity into DCC hiring policies and practices to promote a more inclusive and diverse state workforce.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Data-driven goals</h4>

<p>Achieve a more equitable workforce among occupational groups and classifications throughout DCC, that is reflective of California’s demographics.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Engagement practices</h4>

<p>Engage with CalHR to obtain guidance on equitable hiring practices.&nbsp; Increase interdivisional partnership on recruitment efforts (e.g., job fairs, distribution of job postings, etc.).&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Policy and program initiatives</h4>

<p>Attend recruitment fairs; advertise on recruitment websites including, but not limited to, jobs.ca.gov; update the <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/about-us/work-for-dcc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Work for DCC</a> webpage to appeal to a more diverse pool of potential candidates; and develop a Workforce Development Plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Organizational priority 2: Regulation development&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Ensure an equity specific focus when developing regulations that engages impacted equity licensees early in the regulatory process.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Equity opportunity</h4>

<p>Equity business owners often cite complex regulations as a barrier to entry and an impediment to success in the cannabis industry.&nbsp; Where appropriate, regulatory refinement will be proposed that both expands opportunity and supports equity businesses across the state.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Regulatory development that prioritizes equity businesses may also benefit non-equity businesses by reducing complexity and improving economic conditions in the cannabis industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Data-driven goals</h4>

<p>Increase participation in DCC’s equity fee relief program, supporting licensees in applying for relief and creating awareness of other equity programs.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Engagement practices</h4>

<p>Conduct interviews with equity business owners negatively impacted by the criminalization of cannabis; visit equity licensees in the field; solicit feedback from equity stakeholders; and attend equity-related events.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Policy and program initiatives</h4>

<p>Continue implementation of DCC’s equity fee relief program; provide support to licensees applying for equity fee relief via email; develop and post equity fee relief FAQs; develop and implement a mechanism to provide feedback on regulatory changes from stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Organizational priority 3: Compliance&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Develop easy to understand materials to support businesses owners in maintaining their cannabis licenses and create content that captures effective practices across California equity programs.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Equity opportunity</h4>

<p>Equity business owners often have additional needs in achieving and maintaining licensure and often lack the resources to hire compliance-related support. Content can be developed to support business owners and local jurisdictions.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Data-driven goals</h4>

<p>Increase the number of promising practices included on DCC’s equity resources webpage; increase number of equity business owners interviewed; track the number of promising practices adopted by local jurisdictions; and increase the visibility of materials targeted towards equity licensees.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Engagement practices</h4>

<p>Conduct interviews with the leaders of local jurisdictions implementing equity &amp; compliance programs; contact technical assistance providers supporting business owners in local communities; and collect feedback from equity business owners negatively impacted by the criminalization of cannabis.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Policy and program initiatives</h4>

<p>Develop and publish promising practices for equity businesses and local jurisdictions; promote equity-related content on DCC’s social media accounts; conduct interviews with local jurisdictions to gather information on potential promising practices; and provide targeted support to local jurisdictions developing and implementing equity programs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Organizational priority 4: Licensee support&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Identify data needs for licensees and provide enhanced technical assistance to equity business owners and applicants seeking and receiving cannabis licenses from DCC.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Equity opportunity</h4>

<p>Equity business owners often have limited access to financial support and technical assistance. Materials can be made available to equity licensees to make licensure easier and renewal more accessible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Data-driven goals</h4>

<p>Increase the number of data-based reports released to the public; increase number of equity business applicants and owners assisted by the technical assistance unit; and increase the number of technical assistance materials available to equity licensees.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Engagement practices </h4>

<p>Assist licensees with navigating the equity fee relief process: increase support for licensees applying to other state programs; and conduct outreach to local jurisdictions to determine type of licensing support equity applicants need.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Policy and program initiatives</h4>

<p>Add equity-specific data points to DCC’s licensing system; publish data-based reports that explain the state of equity businesses in the broader cannabis industry; and host equity office hours to discuss publicized materials with the public.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Organizational priority 5: Stakeholder engagement&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Create public spaces to gather regulatory feedback and share information on equity-related policies and issues with interested stakeholders, including utilizing the Cannabis Advisory Committee (CAC) as a forum to develop a more equitable cannabis industry.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Equity opportunity</h4>

<p>Equity stakeholders have expressed a desire for increased communication with DCC regarding issues that disproportionately impact equity businesses and cannabis industry workers.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Data-driven goals</h4>

<p>Increase the amount of direct communication between the public and members of DCC’s Equity and Inclusion Division via in-person events, business visits, virtual meetings, business owner interviews, and information sessions; maintain diversity of backgrounds, regional locations, life experiences, and viewpoints in the composition of CAC members; and ensure meetings and materials are accessible to the public.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Engagement practices</h4>

<p>Regularly solicit feedback from equity stakeholders regarding the challenges and opportunities faced by businesses and workers. Maintain regular contact with equity stakeholders to allow for increased communication between regulators and the public.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Policy and program initiatives</h4>

<p>Conduct yearly equity presentations to the CAC or other equity stakeholders that inform the public about state-wide equity efforts and equity-related data; engage equity business owners directly to ensure comprehensive participation on and with the CAC; and prioritize individuals with equity-related experience when selecting membership on the CAC.</p>
