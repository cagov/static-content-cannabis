<p>Learn how to calculate the fees associated with certain types of cultivation license changes related to the implementation of Senate Bill 833:&nbsp;&nbsp;reducing the size of a cultivation license,&nbsp;placing the cultivation license in Limited Operations Status, and&nbsp;making a one-time change to the expiration date of a processor, nursery, or cultivation license.&nbsp;</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Based on the nature of the modifications requested by the licensee, the Department will calculate fees due, or refund owed.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Example scenario </h2>

<p>A licensee renewed their processor license on October 1, 2023. The licensee would prefer to renew their license annually on February 1, and submits a request to make a one-time change the license’s expiration date, on May 1, 2024.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How a refund is calculated for the original cultivation license</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th>Step</th><th>Calculation formula</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1. Calculate the prorated daily license fee by dividing the annual processor license fee by 365 days in a year.&nbsp;</td><td>$9,370.00 annual processor license fee, divided by 365 days = $25.67 prorated daily license fee.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>2. Calculate the number of licensed days remaining in the original license term, by counting the number of days between the date of the request, May 1, 2024, and the original expiration date, October 1, 2024.</td><td>There are 153 days remaining in the original license term.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>3. Calculate the amount of credit the license is eligible for by multiplying the number of days remaining in the original license term by the prorated daily license fee.</td><td>153 (Step 2) x $25.67 (Step 1) = $3,927.51 credit.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
