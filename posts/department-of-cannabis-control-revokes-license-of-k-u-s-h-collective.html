<p>During its investigation, the DCC found that the licensee was unable to demonstrate that cannabis products represented as having been manufactured on the licensee’s premises were in fact cultivated, processed, manufactured, packed, or held in a location duly licensed as required by California’s adult use cannabis law (“MAUCRSA”). The Department has probable cause to believe the products subject to the embargo may be adulterated or misbranded and therefore, may pose a risk to cannabis consumers.</p>

<p>In the interest of public health and safety, the DCC is implementing an <strong>embargo </strong>on all cannabis products manufactured by K.U.S.H. Collective and is issuing a consumer advisory to alert cannabis consumers to the risks posed by these products.</p>

<p>The DCC is responsible for supporting and enforcing regulatory compliance of licensed commercial cannabis activity to promote accountability and consumer and public safety. This includes investigating alleged violations of MAUCRSA and its implementing regulations, taking administrative and disciplinary action to address such violations, and imposing fines and other sanctions against applicants and licensees who violate California’s laws.</p>
