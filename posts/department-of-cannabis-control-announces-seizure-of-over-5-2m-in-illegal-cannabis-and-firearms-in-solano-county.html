<p>Sacramento &#8211; The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC), in collaboration with local partners, seized over $5.2 million worth of unlicensed cannabis products and five assault rifles during operations targeting illegal indoor cultivation sites in Solano County.</p>

<p>On November 5 and 6, DCC’s Law Enforcement Division (LED), working with Fairfield Police Department, Fairfield Code Enforcement, Suisun City Police, Suisun Code Enforcement and Solano County District Attorney’s Office, served six search warrants across Fairfield and Suisun City.</p>

<p>These operations led to:</p>

<li>A total confiscation of&nbsp;<strong>3,198.94 pounds of illegal cannabis</strong>, five assault rifles, three additional firearms and&nbsp;<strong>$1,337 in cash.</strong></li>

<p>In one alarming discovery, officers found a 3-year-old child within arms&#8217; reach of firearms, hazardous chemicals and illegal cannabis. The child was placed in the care of Child Protective Services. Several sites were also red tagged for dangerous conditions, including mold and toxic chemicals, prompting immediate ventilation and power shutoffs by local code enforcement.</p>

<p>“California will not tolerate illegal cannabis activity, especially that which endangers public safety and undermines our legal market. These operations demonstrate our unwavering commitment to safeguarding our communities and protecting consumers.&#8221; said DCC Director Nicole Elliott.</p>

<p>“These enforcement actions reflect our officers and partner agencies relentless pursuit of and commitment to eliminating the illegal cannabis market,” said Bill Jones, Chief of DCC’s Law Enforcement Division.</p>
