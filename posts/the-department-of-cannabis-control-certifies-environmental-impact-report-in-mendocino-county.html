<p><em>Certification Clears the Path For Over 500 Cannabis Cultivators to Transition to Annual Licensure</em></p>

<p><strong>Sacramento </strong>&#8211; The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) has certified an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) in Mendocino County, addressing a significant and longstanding barrier to annual licensure for over 500 provisionally licensed cultivators. This move allows Mendocino’s provisional licensees – many of whom were part of Mendocino’s rich cannabis history prior to legalization – to transition to annual licenses and continue cannabis cultivation in one of California’s most storied regions.</p>

<p>“Our goal has always been clear: to support those who helped build California’s cannabis industry through a licensing program that is environmentally conscious and legally sound,” said DCC Director Nicole Elliott. “With the EIR certified, we’re one step closer to keeping Mendocino’s pioneering cannabis spirit alive.”</p>

<p>“This project is a testament to what’s possible when legal operators and local and state government work together towards addressing California Environmental Quality Act requirements and focus on meeting an important objective,” said Mo Mulheren, Chair of the Mendocino Board of Supervisors. “The solution developed and implemented by the Department of Cannabis Control and Mendocino County makes it possible for legacy cultivators to focus on what they do best – growing high-quality cannabis legally by eliminating the final roadblocks.”</p>

<p>The DCC will continue reviewing individual annual license applications and preparing addenda to support the ongoing transition of licensees in Mendocino County from provisional to annual licensure. The Department expects the first transitions resulting from today’s certification to occur later this month.</p>
