<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to establish a written allergen control program</h2>

<p>Used in conjunction with the <a href="/2023/10/allergen-guidance/">Allergy Guidance resource</a>, this checklist will assist you in establishing and implementing a written allergen control program as required by the California Code of Regulations, title 4 (4 CCR) section 17214(d)(3), Product Quality Plan.</p>

<p>Each manufacturing premises and its operations are unique. Additional controls may be needed to ensure compliance with the regulations.</p>

<p>Following these steps will assist you to establish a written document that identifies the allergens in your facility, identifies the allergens in each of your cannabis products, and details the steps to take to mitigate against allergen cross-contact and the unintentional or undisclosed incorporation of a food allergen into a cannabis product and the unintentional ingestion of a food allergen by a consumer.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Identify and document the allergens present in your facility</h3>

</ul>
</li>

<li>Document all identified allergens</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Identify and document which of your cannabis products contain allergens</h3>

<ul class="wp-block-list">

</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Identify and implement production controls to mitigate allergen cross-contact </h3>

<p>[4 CCR §17208(a)]</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>When appropriate, use scheduling, cleaning and sanitizing protocols, and dedicated equipment and utensils to mitigate allergen cross-contact</li>

<li>Describe your production controls in writing</li>

<li>Incorporate your production controls into your master manufacturing protocols</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Implement labeling controls </h3>

<p>[4 CCR <em>§17208(a), 4 CCR §17398(c)(3) and 4 CCR §17406(a)(5) &amp; (a)(6)</em>]</p>
