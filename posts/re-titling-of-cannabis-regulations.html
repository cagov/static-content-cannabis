<p><strong>Type</strong>: Section 100</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Approved July 14, 2021</p>

<p>The three existing sets of regulations were moved into one title in the California Code of Regulations. The cannabis regulations are now together in Title 4, Division 19. Sections were also renumbered. No changes were made to the requirements in regulation.</p>

<p>This change used a rulemaking action called a Section 100. Section 100 lets agencies make changes to regulations that have no regulatory effect.</p>
