<p>The Master Manufacturing Protocol is a written document that describes how to make a cannabis product. It lists the type and amount of each ingredient to use and each step that must be followed to safely and consistently produce the product. This protocol helps reduce adulteration risk by preventing incorrect or unintended ingredients from being incorporated into a batch. It includes steps to mitigate the hazards identified in the manufacturing licensee’s Product Quality Plan. It also ensures uniformity among all batches produced by the licensed manufacturer.</p>
