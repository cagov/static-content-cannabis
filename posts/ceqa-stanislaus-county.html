<p>Under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) is serving as the lead agency for environmental review of commercial cannabis projects in Stanislaus County. Five project sites have been identified, and draft environmental documents for each are now available for public review and comment. We invite agencies, stakeholders, and community members to review these documents and share feedback during the formal comment period.</p>

<p>The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) currently issues commercial cannabis cultivation licenses under Division 10 of the Business and Professions Code and California Code of Regulations, title 4, division 19. All legal commercial cannabis activity must be conducted pursuant to state licensing requirements.</p>

<p>Comments received during this period will be reviewed and considered prior to finalization of the documents. For more information on each site and to access the documents, please refer to the links below.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background&nbsp;</h2>

<p>In accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the DCC has assumed the role of lead agency for environmental review of all commercial cannabis activities within Stanislaus County. As lead agency, DCC is responsible for ensuring that proposed cannabis projects comply with CEQA requirements and that potential environmental impacts are evaluated and disclosed to the public and decision makers. </p>

<p>At this time, five commercial cannabis sites have been identified as requiring environmental documents under CEQA. Draft environmental documents have been prepared for each of these sites and are now being circulated for public review and comment. These documents analyze the potential environmental impacts associated with the proposed activities, including cultivation, manufacturing, distribution, and/or retail operations, and propose mitigation measures as appropriate. If certified, DCC will use the documents to issue annual licenses for commercial cannabis activities.&nbsp;</p>
