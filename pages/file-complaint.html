<p>DCC licenses and regulates all commercial cannabis activity in California. This includes the growing, manufacturing, distribution, testing, and sale of cannabis and cannabis products.  If you suspect unlawful business practices, you can file a complaint with DCC. Although some complaints about specific environmental, labor, civil rights, and tax issues may be best handled by other departments, DCC reviews all complaints closely and may make referrals to partner agencies. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When to file a complaint with DCC &nbsp;</h2>

<p>DCC handles most complaints related to commercial cannabis activity, including complaints about unlawful practices at licensed cannabis businesses or complaints about suspected illegal or unlicensed commercial cannabis activity.  </p>

<p>Learn more about specific <a href="/complaints-non-dcc/">complaints that should be made with other agencies</a> since they have primary jurisdiction over issues pertaining to the environment, labor, taxes, discrimination, animal welfare, business disputes, or human trafficking.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to file a complaint&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Complaints made to the Department can be filed anonymously and can be made against licensed or unlicensed cannabis businesses. Gather all of your materials ahead of time. The best complaints provide as much detail as possible, including &nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Name of business, person(s), or licensee name.</li>

<li>Date when you witnessed something&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Address of the business&nbsp;</li>

<li>Phone number of the business&nbsp;</li>

<li>Description of observations. concerns, possible violations.</li>

<li>Documentation, including photos, receipts, timecards, certifications, or copies of email or other communications. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Be aware that incomplete complaints like those without addresses, business names, or contact information can prevent DCC from gathering additional information that could help lead to the resolution of a complaint.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to expect after you file a complaint </h2>

<p>There are several steps we take after a complaint has been filed.&nbsp;</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>DCC will review the complaint to determine if the activity is in violation of the DCC regulations.</li>

<li>&nbsp;Our staff will investigate the facts and review respondents’ responses.</li>

<li>We then review additional information and evidence the complainants and respondents submit. &nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>We may reach out in case we need additional information, so even if you chose to submit a complaint anonymously, we recommend leaving an email address so we can get in touch.</p>

<p>Unless you have requested a follow-up, typically you won’t receive updates on the complaint. Always save your complaint reference number, which you can use to track the status of your complaint.</p>

<p>To check in on the status of your complaint, you can email us with your reference number.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
