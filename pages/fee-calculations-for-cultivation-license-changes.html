<p>Learn how to calculate the fees associated with certain types of cultivation license changes related to the implementation of Senate Bill 833:&nbsp;&nbsp;reducing the size of a cultivation license,&nbsp;placing the cultivation license in Limited Operations Status, and&nbsp;making a one-time change to the expiration date of a processor, nursery, or cultivation license.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Example scenario</h3>

<p>A licensee renewed their medium mixed-light tier 1 license on October 1, 2023. The licensee would prefer to renew their license annually on February 1, and plans to submit a request to make a one-time change to the license’s expiration date, on May 1, 2024. The cultivation licensee would also like to either place the cultivation license in limited operations status or request a reduced-size cultivation license and decides to calculate both fee options to inform their decision.</p>
