<p>Members represent a diversity of viewpoints and communities impacted by commercial cannabis activity, including licensed cannabis businesses, labor, academic research and public health, law enforcement, medical use, local government, and environmental advocacy. This is the first slate of members appointed since DCC’s formation in 2021. Members have been invited to serve two-year terms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pursuant to Division 10 of the Business and Professions Code, the CAC is tasked with advising DCC on the development of relevant standards and regulations for commercial cannabis businesses, including those necessary to protect public health and safety. Key to the CAC’s work will be to ensure DCC is working to create regulations for commercial cannabis activity that helps protect public health and safety while decreasing burdens for legal operators and reducing the illicit market.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The CAC is expected to provide valuable input to DCC’s development of regulations and standards through&nbsp;&nbsp;the comprehensive representation in membership as well as through each individual member’s unique perspectives on consumer, community, and market issues. In addition, the CAC will provide an important venue for DCC to hold robust public discussions that support the development of an innovative regulatory framework that benefits all Californians and results in a safe, sustainable, and equitable cannabis market.</p>

<p>The Department received almost 300 applications from individuals willing to share their time and knowledge with DCC.&nbsp;In selecting committee members, DCC prioritized ensuring a balance of viewpoints and variety of perspectives, maintaining historical knowledge related top previous CAC activities, as well as ensuring the committee reflects the diversity of California and the communities impacted by commercial cannabis activity.</p>

<p>Full CAC meetings will be held quarterly and will be open to the public. The agenda and meeting materials will be posted on the DCC website at least 10 days in advance of the next scheduled meeting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The role of the committee and key representatives included in its composition are established through Business and Professions Code&nbsp;<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&amp;sectionNum=26014.&amp;highlight=true&amp;keyword=advisory%20committee">section 26014</a>.</p>

The DCC develops and implements progressive cannabis policies with robust protections for public health, safety, and the environment.
