<p>Manufacturers extract cannabinoids and terpenes from cannabis plants and make products out of the extract. The types of products they make vary widely and include: food and beverages, vape cartridges, lotions and balms, lozenges and sublingual sprays, pills and tablets, and dab, shatter and wax.</p>

<p>Cannabis manufacturers use techniques and processes common in other types of consumer product manufacturing. Manufacturing steps differ based on the type of manufacturing, but generally include:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Extraction of cannabinoids</li>

<li>Post-processing (refinement) of cannabis extract</li>

<li>Infusion of extract or plant material with other ingredients</li>

<li>Packaging and labeling cannabis products</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="licenses">Manufacturing licenses</h2>

<p>You need a&nbsp;manufacturing license&nbsp;to make cannabis products in California. The type of manufacturing license you need depends on:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>What activities you do</li>

<li>Whether you do extraction and post processing</li>

<li>What types of chemicals you use (if any)</li>
</ul>

<p>You need a different license if you manufacture in a shared-use facility.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="best-practices">Good manufacturing practices</h2>

<p>The Department of Cannabis Control’s regulations require manufacturers to follow good manufacturing practices (GMPs) when making products. GMPs help ensure products are: </p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Free of contaminants and safe for consumers</li>

<li>Produced consistently every time</li>

<li>Labeled correctly</li>
</ul>

<p>Manufacturers must demonstrate GMPs by:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Maintaining a sanitary facility, equipment and utensils</li>

<li>Using written procedures and instructions</li>

<li>Documenting work</li>

<li>Protecting against contamination</li>

<li>Including controls in processes</li>

<li>Practicing personal hygiene</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="documentation">Documenting manufacturing processes</h2>

<p>Manufacturers must keep up-to-date documents with their procedures and instructions for making products.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Product quality plan</h3>

<p>A product quality plan includes:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>An assessment of the potential hazards in your facility and manufacturing practices</li>

<li>The preventative measures you use to mitigate risks</li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="/2023/12/checklist-closed-loop-extraction-systems/">Checklist: closed-loop extraction systems</a></h3>

<p>Cannabis manufacturers who utilize closed-loop extraction systems must ensure their extraction systems are operated and maintained according to the requirements established by DCC. These requirements govern the use of volatile or asphyxiating solvents, or flammable liquids, permissible extraction types, closed-loop extraction systems, and the continued certification of closed-loop extraction systems. This document is intended to outline the requirements that closed-loop extraction system operators must follow to ensure the compliant use of extraction systems.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Packaging</h2>

<p>Manufactured cannabis products must be packaged to prevent product contamination. There are additional requirements for packaging, including being child-resistant, tamper evident, and resealable. Use our guidance documents to ensure your packaging meets requirements.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="/2024/06/ab-1894-and-new-requirements-for-packaging-labeling-advertising-and-marketing/">AB 1894 and new requirements for packaging, labeling, advertising, and marketing</a></h3>

<p>Beginning July 1, 2024, Assembly Bill 1894 will add new requirements for the packaging, labeling, advertising, or marketing of cannabis cartridges and integrated cannabis vaporizers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="/2023/08/child-resistant-packaging-crp/">Child-resistant packaging (CRP)</a></h3>

<p>State law requires that all cannabis goods are sold in child-resistant packaging (CRP). CRP is packaging that is designed to be hard for children under five years of age to open. It is the responsibility of the licensee that packaged the cannabis good to make sure that the package meets CRP requirements.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="/2023/06/packaging-requirements-final-form-cannabis-goods/">Packaging requirements: final form cannabis goods</a></h3>

<p>The Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA) includes basic requirements for how cannabis goods must be packaged before retail sale. These guidelines apply to all nonmanufactured and manufactured cannabis goods that will be sold at a licensed retailer.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Labeling</h3>

<p>Cannabis products must be labeled so consumers know what they’re buying or using. You must list certain information on each part of the label. Use our labeling checklists to make sure your product has the required information. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/2023/06/labeling-requirements-manufactured-cannabis-products-in-final-form/">Labeling checklist for manufactured products</a></h3>

<p>Cannabis goods must be labeled to ensure consumers are informed about what they are buying and to prevent unintended use.
