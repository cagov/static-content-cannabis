<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Robbery</h2>

<ul class="step-list">
<li><strong>Maintain visibility into your place of business.</strong> Keep windows clear of signs or merchandise to avoid blocking the view into your business and keep all entrances, exits and parking areas well lit.</li>

<li><strong>Install a hold-up alarm system.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Protect transactional areas.</strong> Place registers at a safe distance from the door and install physical barriers that are high enough to keep unauthorized persons out of the area where cash transactions take place.</li>

<li><strong>Minimize cash on premises</strong>. Keep your on-premise safe out of sight and locked at all times. &nbsp;Make frequent cash drops to keep cash on premises to a minimum. Use a courier service if you’re dropping cash off premises.</li>

<li><strong>Use more than one person</strong> to open and/or close the business.&nbsp;There is safety in numbers.</li>

<li><strong>Don&#8217;t hesitate to contact the authorities</strong>. Post law enforcement emergency and non-emergency phone numbers in a visible location. Call the police immediately if you see something suspicious.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Burglary</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Secure the premises when closed</strong>. Install high-quality locks and check the condition of the locks on a regular basis. Instruct the last person who leaves the premises to lock all doors and windows and include this step in your written closing instructions. </li>

<li><strong>Install a security system or burglar alarm</strong>. Choose one that includes video surveillance. Check your protection system to make sure it is working properly and have a backup power supply in case of an outage.&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Secure valuables</strong>. Remove all merchandise at the end of each day and place merchandise that can&#8217;t be removed in a safe. </li>

<li><strong>Secure your safe.</strong> Keep it out of customer view and bolt it to the floor or find another way to prevent it from being moved.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Keep your windows clear</strong>. Don’t tint or obscure your windows. This allows burglars to act out of sight once they are inside your business. Apply a protective film to the windows to make them difficult to break or remove</li>

<li><strong>Keep your building well lit</strong>.&nbsp;Burglars prefer to work in the dark, so installing motion lights on the roof and perimeter of your building can deter suspicious activity.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Theft</h2>

<ul>
<li>Consider an employee policy of no handbags or backpacks, or only clear bags.</li>

<li>Review your video footage frequently.</li>

<li>Provide each employee with an individual alarm code.</li>

<li>Limit access to your safe.</li>
</ul>
