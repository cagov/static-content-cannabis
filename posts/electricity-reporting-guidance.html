<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overview: Electricity reporting guidance </h2>

<p>All applications for renewal of a license to engage in commercial cannabis cultivation shall include required reporting for each power source indicated on the application for licensure for the previous annual licensed period (e.g., if you are renewing a license on May 1, 2022, provide the electricity use for May 1, 2021, through April 30, 2022). This guidance will provide licensees with the tools and resources necessary for reporting at time of renewal and for determining whether they are required to meet renewable energy requirements.</p>
