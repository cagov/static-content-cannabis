<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Testing and quality assurance</h2>

<p>Distributors make sure a licensed testing laboratory tests all batches of cannabis goods before they are sold. Distributors can only transport cannabis goods to a retailer for sale if they pass testing. Goods that fail testing are destroyed or sent to a manufacturer for remediation. Before transporting goods to a retailer, type 11 distributors also conduct a quality assurance review.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="testing">New regulations for testing </h3>

<p>As of October 1, 2023, all licensed laboratories are required to conduct compliance testing using <a href="/cannabis-laws/rulemaking/standard-cannabinoids-test-method-and-standardized-operating-procedures/">specific methods adopted by DCC</a>. When arranging for regulatory compliance testing on flower or pre-roll batches, licensed distributors should reference the list below of licensed laboratories in which the Department has completed their method verification review. </p>

<p><sup><sub>Data last updated: December 2023&nbsp;</sub></sup></p>

<p>If a licensed laboratory is not listed above, this means they have not completed the Departmentâ€™s review process and they are not able to test dried flower and non-infused pre-rolls until the process is completed. As additional laboratories complete this process, the Department will update this list.</p>
