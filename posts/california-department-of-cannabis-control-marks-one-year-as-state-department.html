<p><em>Highlighting critical achievements in licensing, enforcement, and equity, DCC celebrates its impact&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>CALIFORNIA – In its first year as a new state department, the California Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) is celebrating critical achievements that foster a safe, sustainable, and equitable cannabis market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Department took steps this year to deliver on the promise of consolidation, establishing regulatory reforms that streamline requirements for cannabis licensees, unifying department operations to more efficiently support the entire supply chain, centralizing complaint reporting, and enhancing access to public resources and information. The Department developed and received approval for eight regulatory packages that, among many things, expand support for equity applicants and licensees and lowers barriers for businesses to attain and maintain licenses.</p>

<p>DCC aggressively pursued staffing, retention, and promotion efforts &#8211; approving 123 hires and promoting 44 staff members to support the creation of a national model for cannabis regulation.</p>

<p>DCC also played an important role in amplifying licensee voices to create meaningful tax reform. The 2022-23 budget and accompanying tax reform bill will provide significant and immediate relief to cannabis businesses, support equity operators, strengthen enforcement tools against illegal cannabis operators, and protect youth, environmental, and public safety programs funding.</p>

<p>“I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve accomplished in just one year and excited about our future,” said Nicole Elliott, DCC Director. “We are committed to making California a national model for a safe, sustainable, and equitable cannabis market and are thankful for our dedicated staff, regulatory partners, and the many others who work hand-in-hand with us to help make this a reality.”</p>
