<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why submit a science amendment?</h2>

<p>There are several reasons to notify the Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) via a Science Amendment. This includes transitioning a cultivation provisional license to an annual license, submitting documentation for a license renewal review, proposing physical modifications to the licensed premises, or modifying previously reported electricity usage.</p>

<p>A Science Amendment can only be submitted by the Designated Responsible Party (DRP) named on the license. There is no fee associated with submitting a Science Amendment. The DRP initiates the Science Amendment process by logging into their account on the Cultivation Licensing System and following the link to My Licenses.</p>
