<p>DCC licenses and regulates all commercial cannabis activity in California. This includes the growing, manufacturing, distribution, testing, and sale of cannabis and cannabis products.  </p>

<p>DCC can also help route complaints about human trafficking, which is a complex issue that requires the involvement of multiple agencies.</p>

<p>You can file an anonymous complaint against licensed or unlicensed cannabis businesses. Provide as much detail as you can. If the complaint is incomplete or we cannot contact you to gather additional information, we may not be able to investigate the complaint.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tips for filing a complaint</strong> with DCC</h2>

<p>You can file an anonymous complaint against any cannabis business, licensed or unlicensed. Provide as much detail as you can. Please be aware that incomplete complaints and lack of contact information can prevent DCC from gathering additional information that could help lead to the resolution of a complaint. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sample complaints</h2>

<p>To ensure your complaint is reviewed, make sure it is done properly, see this as an example.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Our complaints portal</h2>

<p>DCC has an online complaints portal for your convenience. Here is how it works&#8230;</p>

<div class="wp-block-buttons">
<div class="wp-block-button"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button" href="https://search.cannabis.ca.gov/complaints/unlicensed">File a complaint</a></div>
</div>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">After you file a complaint</h2>

<p>Does DCC contact you? How long do you wait before hearing back? Does DCC investigate all items filed?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How DCC&#8217;s Enforcement Division helps&#8230;</h2>

<p>DCC’s Compliance and Enforcement Divisions works with law enforcement and other state agencies to enforce the law. Officers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Investigate complaints of unlicensed or illegal cannabis activity</li>

<li>Stop the sale of cannabis to minors</li>

<li>Prevent unsafe products from entering the cannabis market</li>
</ul>

<p>If you suspect human trafficking at a licensed facility, we encourage you to file a complaint with both DCC and the <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/Complaint.htm">Department of Industrial Relations</a>. If you suspect human trafficking at an unlicensed facility, we recommend you file a report with your local law enforcement office.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Complaints that don&#8217;t go to DCC</h2>

<p>Here are some circumstances when you need to contact a different department.</p>
