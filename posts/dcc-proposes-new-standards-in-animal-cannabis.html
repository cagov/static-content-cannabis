<p>SACRAMENTO, CA — Last week, the California Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) <a href="/cannabis-laws/rulemaking/dcc-2025-02-r-animal-cannabis-product-standards/">announced proposed regulations</a> aimed at creating a clear and regulated pathway for cannabis products intended for pets. These proposed standards are designed to support innovation while prioritizing the health and safety of animals.</p>

<p>“The development of these standards reflects our commitment to fostering a safe marketplace for animal cannabis products,” said Nicole Elliott, Director of the Department of Cannabis Control. “By establishing clear guidelines for manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and testing, we are setting the stage for high-quality products that pet owners can trust. These clear standards not only protect animal health but also encourage responsible innovation, paving the way for growth in this evolving market.”</p>

<p>The proposed regulations focus on three primary product categories: edibles, oral concentrates, and topical products. This structured approach promotes market diversification while maintaining stringent safety measures.</p>

<p>The DCC remains committed to evidence-based policymaking. Current scientific understanding does not support the safety of high-THC products for animals. To mitigate risks, the proposed regulations would limit animal cannabis products to no more than one milligram of total THC per package. This threshold is designed to reduce the potential for adverse effects, ensuring safe and responsible use.</p>
