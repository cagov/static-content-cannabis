<h3><strong>Local Jurisdiction Retail Access Grant</strong></h3>

<p>As of August 2022,&nbsp;<a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/cannabis-laws/where-cannabis-businesses-are-allowed/">61% of California cities and counties (330)</a>&nbsp;do not allow cannabis retailers. This makes it harder for consumers to access safe, tested cannabis products.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Reduce local barriers to access</li><li>Support the expansion of California&#8217;s legal cannabis marketplace</li><li>Reduce the need for consumers to turn to the illicit market</li><li>Reduce the size of the illicit market</li></ul>
