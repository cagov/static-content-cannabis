<h2 class="wp-block-heading">User guide: Renewing your license in the cultivation licensing system</h2>

<p>Your cannabis cultivation license is valid for one year. You can renew your license up to 60 days before your license expires. For example, if your license was granted on November 1<sup>st</sup>, you can begin the renewal process the following September 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The renewal process</h3>

<p>When your license expiration is within the 60-day window for renewal, the licensee will see in the <strong>Action </strong>column a link to <strong>Renew License</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>Be sure you renew before your expiration date, shown clearly in the <strong>Expires On </strong>column. On the day the license expires, if you haven&#8217;t yet renewed, the licensee will receive an email stating that you can still renew after paying a <strong>late fee</strong>.</p>
