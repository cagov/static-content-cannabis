</ul>

<p>According to the value of cannabis seized in 2024, the top 5 counties for UCETF enforcement activity are:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">

<li>Kern: $10,980,530</li>

<li>Los Angeles: $10,616,666</li>
</ul>

<p>As part of its efforts to combat illegal activity across the supply chain, UCETF worked with multiple agencies under Operation &#8220;Grab Bag&#8221; to crack down on unlawful cannabis packaging in Los Angeles&#8217; Toy District. The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) led operation resulted in the seizure of over 2.2 million pieces of illegal cannabis packaging designed to target children, along with counterfeit labels bearing forged with California state seals.</p>

<p>“California is dedicated to eradicating illegal cannabis operations that jeopardize public safety, harm our environment, and undermine the regulated market,” said Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) Director Nicole Elliott. “The progress made in 2024 highlights the strength of our partnerships across state, local, and federal agencies, and we look forward to building on these efforts in the coming year.”</p>

<p>UCETF served 150 search warrants in 46 cities across 20 counties. The counties with the highest search warrant activity are:</p>

<li>Tuolumne (13)</li>

<li>Shasta (12)</li>

<p>“Since its inception, UCETF has worked tirelessly to dismantle large-scale illegal cannabis operations across the state,” said Chuck Bonham, Director of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. “The task force’s 2024 efforts demonstrate our ongoing commitment to ending these harmful activities that threaten California’s safety, natural resources, and public health.”</p>

<p>Alongside traditional search warrant operations, UCETF partners also conducted joint civil and administrative inspections to ensure both consumer and worker safety, including Operation “Safe Limits” which led to the seizure of over 150 boxes of illegal hemp products, along with firearms, narcotics, and cash.</p>

<p>Numerous state agencies, including but not limited to the Department of Cannabis Control (DCC), California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES), California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA), California State Parks, California Environmental Protection Agency&nbsp;(Cal EPA), California National Guard, Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR), Employment Development Department (EDD), California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal/OSHA), Agricultural Labor Relations Board (ALRB), California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR), Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Boards), and California Highway Patrol (CHP), have contributed to these efforts.</p>

<p>Since its inception in 2022, UCETF has seized nearly $600 million in unlicensed cannabis, eradicated 583,000 plants, and confiscated 167 firearms across 380 operations.</p>
