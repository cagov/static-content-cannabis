<p><em>New research released by DCC also finds 62% of Californians believe Proposition 64 has had a positive impact on the state</em>,</p>

<p>CALIFORNIA &#8211; Californians believe the legalization of cannabis has had a positive impact on the state, and they overwhelmingly believe it is important to shop legally, according to polling data released today by the Department of Cannabis Control (DCC). Of the over 1,000 respondents, 86% indicated that it is important to purchase cannabis from the legal market while 72% believe consumers have a responsibility to ensure they are purchasing from a licensed retailer.</p>

<p>The survey, conducted by FM3 Research as part of the Department’s <a href="https://real.cannabis.ca.gov/">Real California Cannabis campaign</a>, also noted that many Californians are confused about cannabis laws. 85% of the people surveyed living in areas where retail cannabis is not allowed either incorrectly thought cannabis retail was allowed in their area, or had no idea about the local laws.</p>

<p>“Education and enforcement are two of the key pillars that support a well-regulated cannabis market,” said DCC Director Nicole Elliott. “The Real California Cannabis campaign will provide cannabis consumers with information that empowers them to make informed decisions regarding their cannabis purchases. These smart choices support safer communities, local businesses, and our continuous efforts to disrupt the illegal market.”</p>

<p>In addition, polling results found:</p>

<ul>
<li>88% of respondents who have consumed cannabis said they would purchase cannabis products from a licensed retailer.</li>

<li>56% of respondents said they have used cannabis.</li>

<li>44% percent said it was easy to identify if a retailer was licensed.</li>

<li>42% said it was difficult to tell if a retailer was licensed or unlicensed.</li>
</ul>

<p>DCC&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.real.cannabis.ca.gov/">Real California Cannabis</a>&#8221; campaign is designed to educate cannabis consumers about the benefits of purchasing legal cannabis and how to identify the differences between licensed and unlicensed cannabis retailers.  </p>

<p>FM3 Research interviewed over 1,000 California adults, in both English and Spanish, to compile the survey data.</p>
