<h2>About the farm&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Swami Chaitanya and Nikki Lastreto are&nbsp;founders&nbsp;of Swami Select, a cannabis brand grown at their farm, Ganja Ma Gardens, in the heart of California’s Emerald Triangle. Swami Select cannabis is sun-grown, cultivated in soil using regenerative, organic methods for healthy, healing, inspirational use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After learning about cannabis and its various uses while traveling the world, Swami and Nikki settled in Mendocino County and began growing cannabis in 2004. They’ve learned and modified their methods along the way to ensure their creations are made thoughtfully and sustainably, using methods that protect biodiversity and ensure consistent quality.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Commitment to the legal market</h2>

<p>“I never knew too much about politics, but cannabis has taught me so much,” Swami said. “We’ve learned about public speaking, how to tell our story and ask for what we need in front of the board of supervisors.” Living through the height of the cannabis legalization movement, Swami and Nikki have become advocates for legal cultivation.&nbsp;Starting in&nbsp;2016, they attended&nbsp;many&nbsp;Mendocino County Board of Supervisor’s meetings and helped s“I never knew too much about politics, but cannabis has taught me so much,” Chaitanya said. “We’ve learned about public speaking, how to tell our story and ask for what we need in front of the board of supervisors.” Living through the height of the cannabis legalization movement, Chaitanya and Lastreto have become advocates for legal cultivation.&nbsp;Starting in&nbsp;2016, they attended&nbsp;many&nbsp;Mendocino County Board of Supervisor’s meetings and helped shape legislation around growing cannabis. More recently, they have been working with the&nbsp;California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) on the Appellations program to ensure the guidelines support small, independent farmers.</p>

<h2>Proud to be a licensed grower</h2>

<p>When they started growing cannabis, they knew it would not be just about making money, but it would be a lot about education. Teaching others about the benefits and the history of cannabis helps break down the stigma around the plant and shows&nbsp;that it really is medicine. “The use of cannabis is an ancient tradition, and we feel that it’s our duty to revive the history because it’s a noble history,” Chaitanya said. As cannabis becomes legalized in other states and in different countries across the world, Chaitanya and Lastreto&nbsp;&nbsp;hope to continue educating others as they work to preserve the history and uses of the cannabis plant. &nbsp;</p>
