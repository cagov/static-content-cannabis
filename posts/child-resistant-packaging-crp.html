<p>State law requires that all cannabis goods are sold in child-resistant packaging (CRP). CRP is packaging that is designed to be hard for children under five years of age to open. It is the responsibility of the licensee that packaged the cannabis good to make sure that the package meets CRP requirements.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overview</h2>

<p>There are three types of packaging that qualify as child-resistant:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Packages that have been certified as child-resistant under the requirements of the <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Business--Manufacturing/Business-Education/Business-Guidance/PPPA">Poison Prevention Packaging Act</a> (PPPA, 16 CFR 1700.15(b)(1)). To meet this standard, packaging must be tested and certified as meeting the PPPA standards. You can ask your packaging supplier if the packaging you are considering has PPPA-compliant certification.</li>

<li>A bottle sealed with a pry-off metal crown cork-style bottle cap (for packages containing only a single serving).</li>

<li>Plastic packaging that is at least 4 mils thick and heat-sealed without an easy-open tab, dimple, corner, or flap (for packages of cannabis goods that qualify for single-use CRP or that contain only a single serving).</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Types of child-resistant packaging</h2>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Single Use (“Initial CRP”)</strong>: The package is initially child-resistant, but once opened, it is no longer child-resistant. If used, the package’s label must say “This package is not child-resistant after opening.”</li>

<li><strong>Multiple Use (“Lifetime CRP”):</strong> The package maintains its child-resistance throughout the life of the package. It can be opened and closed, but still remains child-resistant.</li>
</ul>
