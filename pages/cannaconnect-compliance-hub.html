		<summary>Click to view the temporary cannabis events FAQ</summary>
		<div class="accordion-body">

<p><strong>What licenses are required to hold a temporary cannabis event?</strong></p>

<p>You need two licenses to hold a cannabis event. First you must obtain a cannabis event organizer license. Next, you must apply for a temporary cannabis event license at least 60 calendar days before the first day of the temporary cannabis event and obtain the license before the event begins.</p>

<p><strong>How long is the temporary cannabis event license valid?</strong></p>

<p>A temporary cannabis event license will only be issued for a single day or up to 4 consecutive days. No temporary cannabis event licenses will be issued for more than 4 days. In your application, you must request a temporary event license for the days you intend to hold the event.</p>

<p><strong>As a cannabis event organizer do I have to be onsite at the event?</strong></p>

<p>You must have a designated contact person(s) who will be onsite at the event and reachable by telephone at all times during the event. The designated contact person(s) must be disclosed in your application for the temporary cannabis event.</p>

<p><strong>What are the security requirements for a temporary cannabis event?</strong></p>

<p>The cannabis event organizer must hire or contract for security personnel to provide security services at the licensed temporary cannabis event. Security personnel must be at least 21 years of age, licensed by the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services, and comply with chapters 11.4 and 11.5 of division 3 of the Business and Professions Code.</p>

<p>Only licensed retailers (including non-storefront retailers) and licensed microbusinesses authorized to conduct retail sales may sell cannabis goods at a temporary cannabis event.</p>

<p><strong>Where can sales of cannabis goods occur?</strong></p>

<p>All sales of cannabis goods at a temporary cannabis event must occur in an area designated for retail sales in the premises diagram.</p>

<p>Sales activities by a licensed retailer or microbusiness may only occur within the licensee’s specifically assigned area that was identified in the premises diagram. Mobile sales activities via wagon, car, or similar means are prohibited.</p>

<p><strong>Do cannabis goods, to be sold at an event, need to be transported to and from a temporary cannabis event by a distributor?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. Cannabis goods that will be offered for sale by a licensed retailer or microbusiness must be transported from the licensed premises of the retailer or microbusiness to the event by a licensed distributor. At the end of the event unsold cannabis goods must be transported by a licensed distributor back to the premises of the licensed retailer or microbusiness.</p>

<p>Distributors may conduct transport for more than one licensee at a time in accordance with the regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Do daily sales limits apply at a temporary cannabis event?</strong></p>

<p>Acceptable forms of identification include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A document issued by a federal, state, county, or municipal government, or a political subdivision or agency thereof, including, but not limited to, a valid motor vehicle operator&#8217;s license, that contains the name, date of birth, height, gender, and photo of the person.</li>
