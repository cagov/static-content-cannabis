<p>Q: What process will licensees follow to account for this change?&nbsp;</p>

<p>A: CA Industry Bulletin (link to bulletin with process diagram) describes the new functionality being implemented in the system and includes a process flow diagram to illustrate the actions that licensees will need to take.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Q: Do all licensees need to participate in this change?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A: All licensees who transfer products from their licensed premises to another licensed premises or receive transferred products from another licensed premises will need to participate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Q: How long do licensees have to approve Pending Transfers?&nbsp;</p>

<p>A: Transporter and destination licensees will have 48 hours to approve a Pending Transfer. If the transfer is not approved by both the transporter and destination licensees in that timeframe, the transfer will be automatically cancelled and the originating licensee will need to start the process over again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Q: If I do business with another licensee frequently, can I obtain an exemption from the Transfer Approval functionality?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A: Exemptions cannot be issued, however, functionality exists to designate “Approved Shippers”. Within the Metrc user interface, transporter and destination licensees can choose to “auto-approve” product shipments from individual origin licensees. In this way, you can streamline the approval process by auto-approving product transfers from trusted partners. These auto-approvals expire over time, but reinstating them can be accomplished by following the same process. The current expiration period is set at 365 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Q: Will my third-party software provider take care of this within my POS system or other integrated software?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A: No, since all transfers need to be executed within the Metrc user interface, there are no API changes or third-party components which can address Transfer Approvals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
