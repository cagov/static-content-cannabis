<p><strong>Type:</strong>&nbsp;Regular rulemaking (certificate of compliance)</p>

<p><strong>Status:</strong>&nbsp;Approved and filed with the Secretary of State on December 15, 2022. Effective as of December 15, 2022</p>

<p>The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) is providing notice to the public of its intent to permanently adopt its emergency regulations to provide license fee waivers and to implement fee deferrals under the Department’s equity fee relief program. Senate Bill 166 required DCC to develop and implement a program to provide waivers for cannabis licensing fees, with at least 60 percent of the total amount of fee waivers allocated&nbsp;to fee waivers&nbsp;for local equity applicants and licenses. The cannabis equity fee waiver program is designed to assist commercial cannabis license applicants and licensees who have been harmed by the War on Drugs.</p>
