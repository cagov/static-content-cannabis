<p>The CAC will consider recommendations for the Local Jurisdiction Retail Access Grant Program, a $20 million state grant administered by DCC which will support local governments in establishing local retail permitting programs and which aims to expand consumer access to legal retailers statewide. As of February 2022, 61% of California cities and counties do not allow establishment of cannabis retailers. The meeting will also include presentations from DCC leadership.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The CAC advises DCC on the development of relevant standards and regulations for commercial cannabis businesses, including those necessary to protect public health and safety. The CAC provides an important venue for DCC to hold robust public discussions that support the development of an innovative regulatory framework that benefits all Californians and results in a safe, sustainable, and equitable cannabis market.&nbsp;</p>
