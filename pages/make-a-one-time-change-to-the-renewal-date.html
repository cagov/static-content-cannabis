<p>Selecting this option allows the cultivator to permanently modify the renewal date one time to provide more flexibility for when fees are due.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Definition</h3>

<ul>
<li>“Modified License Term” means-<ul><li>A timeframe that is less than 12 months; and</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Falls between the original and the modified date of renewal. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Eligibility</h3>

<ul>
<li>All cultivation license types, including Nursery and Processor, are allowed to modify their renewal date one time.</li>

<li>Modification of the renewal date is only allowed once per cultivation license and becomes permanent once the renewal is paid and approved.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Fees</h3>

<ul>
<li>Cultivators will receive a prorated annual license fee for the Modified License Term.
<ul>
<li>The prorated fee is calculated by dividing the applicable annual license fee by 365 and multiplying that value by the number of days between the date the original and modified renewal date.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Formula-</p>

<p>(Existing Annual Fee / 365)&nbsp; x Number of Days = New Annual Fee</p>

<p>Example-</p>

<p>Small Outdoor license type = $4,820 annual fee</p>

<p>Current Expiration Date = March 1, 2025</p>

<p>Modified Expiration Date = November 1, 2025</p>

<p>Calculation-</p>

<p>($4,820 / 365) x 245 = $3,235.34</p>

<p>Prorated Fee-</p>

<p>New Annual Fee = $3,235.34</p>
