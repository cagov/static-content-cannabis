<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tips for submitting a comment</strong>&nbsp;</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Include the section number or topic</strong>. This helps us understand what you’re commenting on.&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Be specific</strong>. Tell us how the regulation affects or would affect you. Include data or examples, where relevant.&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Comment only on what’s being proposed</strong>. DCC will only consider comments related to the proposed regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Phrase it as a statement</strong>. Instead of posing a question, phrase your comment as a statement. For example, instead of “What does this mean?” say “The wording of this section is confusing, so I don’t understand what it would require me to do.”&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Tell us what you like, too</strong>. Share which proposals you like, not just the ones you want to see changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Share a suggestion, if you have one</strong>. Tell us what you would prefer and why you think it would be better. Sharing an alternative helps us consider how the regulation could be made better.&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>You only need to submit once</strong>. Your comment is registered once, no matter how many times you send it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Don’t include confidential or private information</strong>. Comments become part of the public record. Don’t include information that you wouldn’t want shared with others.&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Submit your comment by the deadline.</strong>&nbsp;Make sure your comment is submitted before the end of the designated comment period, so it can be considered.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
