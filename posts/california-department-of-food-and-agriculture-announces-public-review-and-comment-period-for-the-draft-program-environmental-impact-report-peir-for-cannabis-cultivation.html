<p>The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) has prepared a Draft Program Environmental Impact Report (PEIR) outlining potential environmental effects associated with the adoption and implementation of statewide cannabis cultivation regulations. CDFA is developing regulations for statewide medical and adult-use (non-medical) cannabis cultivation licensing, as well as a track-and-trace system. This system will record the movement of cannabis and cannabis products through the supply chain, from cultivation to sale.</p>
<p>The Draft PEIR, released in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), triggers a 45-day public review and comment period to allow agencies and interested parties the opportunity to provide input on the environmental analyses, mitigation measures, and alternatives associated with statewide cannabis cultivation. The Legal Notice for the Draft PEIR is available at <strong><a href="https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/is/mccp/">calcannabis.cdfa.ca.gov</a></strong>.</p>
<p>CDFA has scheduled four public workshops in July to provide the public and regulatory agencies an opportunity to ask questions and submit comments on the draft PEIR. CDFA will serve as the lead agency pursuant to CEQA and will consider public comments regarding the scope and content of the information included in the PEIR.</p>
<p>All of the following Draft PEIR workshops will be held from 6pm to 8pm.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tuesday, July 11</strong>: Weaverville Veterans Memorial Hall, 101 Memorial Lane, Weaverville, CA 96093</li>
