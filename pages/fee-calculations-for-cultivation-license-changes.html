<p>Learn how to calculate the fees associated with certain types of cultivation license changes related to the implementation of Senate Bill 833:  reducing the size of a cultivation license, placing the cultivation license in Limited Operations Status, and making a one-time change to the expiration date of a processor, nursery, or cultivation license. </p>

<!--more-->

<p>Based on the nature of the modifications requested by the licensee, the Department will calculate fees due, or refund owed.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Example scenario </h2>

<p>A licensee renewed their processor license on October 1, 2023.  The licensee would prefer to renew their license annually on February 1, and submits a request to make a one-time change the license’s expiration date, on May 1, 2024.   </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How a refund is calculated for the original cultivation license</strong> </h3>

<p>Calculate the prorated daily license fee by dividing the annual processor license fee by 365 days in a year. </p>

<p>Calculation formula&nbsp;</p>

<p>$9,370.00 annual processor license fee, divided by 365 days = $25.67 prorated daily license fee.  </p>

<p>Calculate the number of licensed days remaining in the original license term, by counting the number of days between the date of the request, May 1, 2024, and the original expiration date, October 1, 2024.</p>

<p>Result:  </p>

<p>There are 153 days remaining in the original license term. </p>

<p>Calculate the amount of credit the license is eligible for by multiplying the number of days remaining in the original license term by the prorated daily license fee. </p>

<p>Calculation formula  </p>

<p>153 (Step 2) x $25.67 (Step 1) = $3,927.51 credit. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How fees are calculated for a modified my license term </strong> </h3>

<p>Calculate the number of days in the modified license term, by counting the number of days between the date of the request, May 1, 2024, and the new expiration date on February 1, 2025.</p>

<p>There are 276 days in the modified license term. </p>

<p>Calculate the fee for the modified license term by multiplying the number of days in the modified license term by the prorated daily license fee.  </p>

<p>Calculation formula </p>

<p>276 (Step 4) x $25.67 (Step 1) = $7,084.92 modified license fee. </p>

<p>Calculate the amount due, by subtracting the credit calculated in Step 3 from the modified license fee calculated in Step 5. </p>

<p>Calculation formula </p>

<p>$7,084.92 (Step 5) &#8211; $3,927.51 (Step 3) = $3,157.56 due to DCC for the modified license term. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">To calculate fees due to limit operations </h3>

<p>Follow Steps 1 – 3 to calculate the change of expiration date and then follow the bullets below</p>

<p>Calculate the number of days in the modified license term, by counting the number of days between the date of the request, May 1, 2024, and the new expiration date on February 1, 2025.</p>

<p>There are 276 days in the modified license term.</p>

<p>Calculate the prorated daily license fee of the limited operations status by multiplying the annual license fee for a medium mixed-light tier 1 license by 20%, then dividing by 365 days in a year.</p>

<p>Calculation formula &#8211; $25,970.00 medium mixed-light tier 1 license fee x 20% limited operations status = $5,194.00. Next divide $5194.00 by 365 days = $14.23 prorated daily license fee for limited operations status.</p>

<p>Calculate the modified license fee by multiplying the number of days in the modified license term, by the prorated daily license fee for the limited operations status.</p>

<p>Calculation formula – 276 (Step 4) x $14.23 (Step 5) = $3,927.48 modified license fee</p>

<p>Calculate the amount due, by subtracting the credit calculated in step 3 from the modified license fee calculated in Step 6.</p>

<p>Calculation formula &#8211; $3,927.28 (Step 6) &#8211; $10,885.95 (Step 3) = ($6,958.47) in remaining credit that will be refunded by the DCC.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">To calculate fees due to reduce the size of the cultivation license </h3>

<p>Follow Steps 1 – 3 to calculate the change of expiration date and then follow the bullets below:</p>

<p>Calculate the modified license fee by multiplying the number of days in the modified license term by the prorated daily license fee for the reduced-size cultivation license.</p>

<p>Calculation formula – 276 (Step 4) x $32.33 (Step 5) = $8.923.08 modified license fee.</p>

<p>Calculate the amount due, by subtracting the credit calculated in Step 3 from the modified license fee calculated in Step 6.</p>

<p>Calculation formula &#8211; $8923.08 (Step 6) &#8211; $10,885.95 (Step 3) = ($1,962.87) in remaining credit that will be refunded by the DCC.</p>
