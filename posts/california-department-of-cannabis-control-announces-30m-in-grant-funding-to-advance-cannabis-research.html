<p><strong>SACRAMENTO —</strong> To increase public understanding of cannabis and to better inform future laws impacting the state’s industry, the California Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) is soliciting research proposals from California public universities. Up to $30 million in grant funding is available to support cannabis-related academic research that address critical gaps in scientific knowledge and guide future policy decisions.</p>

<p>With this round of funding, California will have invested $80 million to support cannabis related research, with topics ranging from the industry’s economic health to preventing cannabis related harm. This latest round reinforces California’s commitment to supporting rigorous, independent research in an area of growing national importance, especially as more states move towards legalization and more Americans use cannabinoid products.</p>

<p>“At a time when the federal government is pulling back funding for cannabis-related research, California is stepping up,” said <strong>DCC Director Nicole Elliott</strong>. “DCC is proud to partner with California’s world-class public universities to generate the data and insights necessary to inform thoughtful policy, protect public health, and guide the evolution of this industry responsibly. These impacts don’t stop at our borders – what the Department learns here will shape important conversations and policies across the nation.”</p>

<p>For this round of funding opportunities, DCC is prioritizing topics that build on existing research and leverage insights nationwide, fostering a more connected and wholistic understanding of cannabis.</p>

<p>Priority research areas include:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Educational approaches to improve public health and safety</li>

<li>Analysis of cannabis crop yields</li>

<li>Examinations of state and local policies</li>

<li>Consumer preferences and behavior</li>

<li>Impacts on the human body and mental health</li>

<li>Environmental sustainability</li>

<li>Comparative analyses of enforcement strategies</li>
</ul>

<p>A complete list of priority topics can be found on the DCC website.</p>

<p>All research findings will be made available to the public, at no cost, to support broad access to science-backed research while contributing to the national understanding of cannabis.<br>This $30 million grant program is funded by cannabis tax revenues established under Proposition 64 (2016), which legalized adult-use cannabis, decriminalized personal possession, and began addressing the harms caused by cannabis prohibition. The new funding builds on $50 million in research grants previously awarded to California academic institutions in 2020 and 2023.</p>
