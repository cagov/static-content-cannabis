<p>DCC licenses and regulates commercial cannabis activity in California. A complaint can be submitted if an individual or business is suspected of violating DCC’s laws and regulations.</p>

<p>If a complaint does not fall within DCC’s regulatory jurisdiction, we may refer the complaint to the appropriate local, State, or federal agency on your behalf. Issues outside of DCC’s regulatory jurisdiction may be related to:</p>

<p>Complainants are required to provide contact information to allow DCC to gather any additional information about the complaint. Although contact information is required, there is the option to remain anonymous and DCC will not publicly disclose the complainant’s contact information to the extent authorized by law.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to expect after you file a complaint </h2>

<p>After a complaint has been submitted, DCC analysts will determine if the issue falls within DCC’s regulatory jurisdiction or should be referred to a partner agency. For matters within DCC’s primary jurisdiction, the analysts will review the complaint to determine if the activity violates regulations and the subsequent course of action.</p>

<p>The complainant will not be informed of the outcome of their complaint nor can DCC provide information on open investigations.</p>
