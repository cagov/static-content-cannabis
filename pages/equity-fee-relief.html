<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Business eligibility</h2>

<p>There are two basic requirements for getting equity fee relief. If your business meets them both, you’re eligible for a waiver.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Gross revenue</h3>

<p>Your cannabis business must have gross revenue of no more than $5 million per year. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If you’re starting a new business, you must expect no more than $5 million in gross revenue in your first year.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Equity ownership:</h3>

<p>This criterion applies to fee waivers and fee deferrals.</p>

<p>At least 50% of your business must be owned by people who meet one of the following equity criteria:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cannabis conviction or arrest</li>

<li>Income level</li>

<li>Neighborhood affected by criminalization of cannabis</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Example 1</h3>

<p>2 people each own 50% of the business.&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Owner 1 meets the impact criteria </li>
</ul>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Owner 2 does not meet the impact criteria </li>
</ul>

<p>The business qualifies for equity fee relief. 50% of the business is owned by people who meet the impact criteria.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Example 2</h3>

<p>6 people own the business.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Owners 1, 2, and 3 each own 20% and meet the impact criteria</li>

<li>Owner 4 owns 20% and does not meet the impact criteria</li>

<li>Owners 5 and 6 each own 10% and do not meet the impact criteria</li>
</ul>

<p>The business qualifies for equity fee relief. 60% of the business is owned by people who meet the impact criteria.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Example 3</h3>

<p>5 people each own 20% of the business.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Owners 1 and 2 meet the equity criteria</li>

<li>Owners 3, 4, and 5 do not meet the impact criteria</li>
</ul>

<p>The business does not qualify for equity fee relief.</p>

<p>Only 40% of the business is owned by people who meet the impact criteria.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Equity owner criteria</h2>

<p>Business owners can show they were impacted by cannabis criminalization in a number of ways. You only need to meet one of the criteria to qualify.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cannabis conviction or arrest</h3>

<p>You were convicted or arrested for one of these cannabis crimes before November 8, 2016:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Sale</li>

<li>Possession</li>

<li>Use</li>

<li>Manufacture</li>

<li>Cultivation</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also be eligible if an immediate family member was convicted or arrested for a cannabis-related crime and you lived in a California county with drug arrest rates that were higher than the state average drug arrest rates.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Live in an area with a population disproportionately impacted by past criminal justice policies (census tract or family member conviction or arrest)</h3>

<p>You lived in a place for at least 5 years between 1980 and 2016 that was a California county with drug arrest rates that were higher than the state average drug arrest rates and:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The top 25% nationally for unemployment and poverty; or</li>

<li>You have an immediate family member who was convicted or arrested for a cannabis-related crime prior to November 8, 2016.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use our <a href="https://maps.gis.ca.gov/DCC/map.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">map tool</a> to see if you live in a qualifying area.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Income<strong></strong></h3>

<p>Your household income is no more than 60% of the area’s median income, or you’re eligible to get financial aid through a program like:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>CalFresh</li>

<li>MediCal</li>

<li>CalWORKS</li>

<li>Supplemental security income</li>

<li>Social Security disability</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Area median income</h4>

<p>You may qualify for equity fee relief if your household income is not more than 60% of the state&#8217;s listed median income for a household the size of yours located in your area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>To find the state&#8217;s listed median income for your household, visit the <a href="https://www.hcd.ca.gov/grants-and-funding/income-limits/state-and-federal-income-rent-and-loan-value-limits">California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) website</a> and review the most recent HCD State Income Limits PDF. </p>

<p>To determine if you qualify find the county you currently live in and look at the column that lists the number of people living in your household.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
