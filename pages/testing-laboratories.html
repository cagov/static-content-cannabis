<p>Testing laboratories make sure cannabis goods are safe for consumption. The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) requires all batches of cannabis goods to be tested before they can be sold. Testing labs test cannabis goods to make sure they’re free of contaminants and labeled with accurate amounts of cannabinoids and terpenes.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Required testing</h2>

<p>Testing labs test cannabis goods for:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cannabinoids and terpenes</li>

<li>Residual solvents and processing chemicals</li>

<li>Residual pesticides</li>

<li>Heavy metals</li>

<li>Microbial impurities</li>

<li>Mycotoxins</li>

<li>Moisture content and water activity</li>

<li>Foreign material</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reporting test results</h2>

<p>Testing labs report results on a Certificate of Analysis (COA). The COA says whether the batch passes or fails testing for each substance.</p>

<p>Labs can only issue COAs and results after they finish all tests. Labs cannot change them after they’re issued without permission from DCC.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sending results to DCC</h2>

<p>Within one day of finishing a batch&#8217;s testing, the testing lab must: </p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Upload the COA to the track and trace system</li>

<li>Send a copy of the COA to DCC; email <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:testinglabs@cannabis.ca.gov" target="_blank">testinglabs@cannabis.ca.gov</a> </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="remediation">Cannabis goods that fail testing</h2>

<p>Batches of cannabis goods that fail testing can only be:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Destroyed by the distributor</li>

<li>Remediated by a manufacturer</li>
</ul>

<p>Remediation removes contaminants from a product. Only manufacturers can remediate a product. DCC must approve your remediation plan in advance. After remediation, you must retest cannabis goods, which ensures the contaminant was removed. If the goods pass testing, they can be sold.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="remediation">How to submit a remediation plan</h3>

<p>To request permission to remediate cannabis goods, email <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:remediation@cannabis.ca.gov" target="_blank">remediation@cannabis.ca.gov</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reliability of test results</h2>

<p>Testing laboratories must:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Become ISO accredited</li>

<li>Use standard operating procedures </li>

<li>Develop a laboratory quality assurance program</li>

<li>Participate in a proficiency testing program</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">ISO accreditation</h3>

<p>Cannabis testing labs in California must maintain to ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation. ISO accreditation is a measure of quality used by universities and research centers worldwide. This standard, established by experts, requires labs to show:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Technical competency</li>

<li>Reliability of test results</li>
</ul>
