<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Does requesting an informal proceeding start the appeals process?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>No, it does not start the appeals process.&nbsp; These informal proceedings such as an informal conference provided pursuant to a Citation, or an informal hearing provided pursuant to an EDO may be requested and held prior to an administrative hearing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The timeframe for requesting an informal proceeding will vary depending on the type of compliance or licensing action taken.&nbsp; Informal proceedings do not change or delay the timeline for requesting an administrative hearing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additional information about informal conferences can be found by reviewing <a href="https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Document/IC7791470697311ED8FE2A6AEAC82CCBB?viewType=FullText&amp;originationContext=documenttoc&amp;transitionType=CategoryPageItem&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California Code of Regulations, Title 4, section 17803</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How does an applicant or licensee initiate the appeals process?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The first step to initiating the appeals process is to request an administrative hearing, also known as a formal hearing.&nbsp; Instructions are provided to the applicant or licensee when the compliance or licensing action is served by DCC. In some circumstances, cases may be resolved between DCC and the impacted party through an informal proceeding. If resolved informally, the need to participate in a formal hearing becomes unnecessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What happens during an administrative hearing?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The administrative hearing will be held before an administrative law judge (ALJ) at the Office of Administrative Hearings. The applicant or licensee may be represented by an attorney, or they can represent themselves at the hearing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the administrative hearing, DCC staff may testify regarding the basis for the compliance or licensing action. The applicant or licensee may also testify and/or present evidence.&nbsp; Upon completion of the formal hearing, the ALJ has 30 days to prepare a Proposed Decision for consideration by the DCC Director.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additional information about administrative hearings can be found by visiting the <a href="https://www.dgs.ca.gov/OAH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Office of Administrative Hearing website</a>, and reviewing <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&amp;sectionNum=11517." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Government Code, section 11517</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What happens once the Proposed Decision is issued? </strong> </h2>

<p>Upon receiving the Proposed Decision, the DCC Director, or their designee, has 100 days to decide whether to adopt the proposed decision, reject it, or make changes to it that don’t require rejection.&nbsp; If the Director or their designee rejects the Proposed Decision, DCC will send a Notice of Rejection to the applicant or licensee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the Director or their designee adopts the Proposed Decision, or makes changes to it that don’t require rejection, the Proposed Decision becomes a Final Decision, and the appellant can choose to appeal the Final Decision to the Cannabis Control Appeals Panel (CCAP).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>CCAP only accepts appeals from annual commercial cannabis licensees and applicants that have been issued a Final Decision by DCC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>(<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&amp;sectionNum=26043." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Business and Professions Code section 26043</a>)&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the Cannabis Control Appeals Panel (CCAP)?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>CCAP is a government agency, a separate entity from DCC, that provides fair, accessible, and timely quasi-judicial resolution of appeals from DCC compliance and licensing decisions.&nbsp; CCAP is comprised of five appointed members.&nbsp; Three members are appointed by the Governor, one by the Senate Committee on Rules, and one by the Speaker of the Assembly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>To learn more about CCAP, <a href="https://www.ccap.ca.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">visit the Cannabis Control Appeals Panel website</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the process for appealing a Final Decision?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The applicant or licensee may appeal a Final Decision by filing a Notice of Appeal with the Cannabis Control Appeals Panel (CCAP<strong>)</strong>.&nbsp; The Notice of Appeal must be received by CCAP within 30 days after the final day on which DCC may reconsider its decision. Provisional license revocations and suspensions cannot be appealed to CCAP.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Filing a Notice of Appeal with CCAP triggers an <em>automatic stay</em> of the Final Decision issued by DCC, meaning that the decision is not enforced while the appeal is pending.&nbsp; DCC may file a motion to vacate the automatic stay to attempt to prove that the stay would endanger public health, safety, or welfare.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the possible outcomes of a CCAP hearing?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>A CCAP hearing may be concluded in the following ways:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>the CCAP affirms DCC’s decision,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>the CCAP reverses DCC’s decision,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>the CCAP dismisses the appeal, or&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>the CCAP remands the matter back to DCC for reconsideration&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>CCAP must issue its decision and final order within 90 days after the hearing has completed.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Can the outcome of the Cannabis Control Appeals Panel (CCAP) hearing be appealed?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Yes, the applicant or licensee, or DCC may appeal the CCAP decision to a California District Court of Appeal or California Supreme Court within 30 days of the CCAP decision.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court will review the record and render a decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
