<p>Once all Owner Applications and the DRP’s Declarations and Final Affidavit are submitted, you can pay the application fee.</p>

<p>After the Declaration and Final Affidavit is submitted, the system sends an email to the DRP and displays an announcement with information to log in, find the application record, then open the attachments section found in the Record Info tab.<br>Two PDF documents are attached to your application – an instruction letter to tell you how to pay your application fee, and an invoice for the fee.<br>Note: The application fee is the first of two fees. Once your application fee is received, the department’s Licensing Program staff will review your application, and if approved, you will be asked to pay your license fee before your license can be issued.</p>
