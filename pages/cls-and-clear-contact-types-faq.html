<h2 class="wp-block-heading">FAQs</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Q: How can I modify or change a contact listed on my application or license?</h3>

<p>A: Only the DRP can modify or change a contact associated with an application or license record. To modify or change a contact, the DRP must submit a completed <a href="/2024/01/notifications-and-requests-to-modify-a-license/">Form 27: Notifications and Requests to Modify a License</a> using the email address registered to them in the licensing system.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Q: What is a legal representative?</h3>

<p>A: Legal representatives must be licensed to practice law in California. The DRP associated with an application or license may provide written permission for DCC to communicate with a legal representative by initiating the inquiry from the email address associated with them in the licensing system. The DRP must remain on the communication thread until the inquiry is closed.</p>

<p>This contact does not have access to the application or license record.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Q: What is a licensing system notice?</h3>

<p>A: Licensing system notices, or system notices, are automated messages generated and distributed through either the CLS or CLEaR system. Contact types that receive system notices may also receive important applicant and licensee updates from DCC.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Q: What should an applicant or licensee do if the DRP becomes incapacitated and cannot fulfill their roles and responsibilities?</h3>

<p>A: In the event of the death or incapacity of a DRP, documentation may be submitted to DCC requesting the addition of a successor in interest to the application or license record.  The individual requesting the successor in interest must complete and submit <a href="/2024/01/notifications-and-requests-to-modify-a-license/">Form 27: Notifications and Requests to Modify a License,</a> along with any supporting documentation, to DCC for review and approval. </p>
