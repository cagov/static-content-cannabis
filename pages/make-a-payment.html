<li>Specify what the payment is for, such as a licensing renewal or licensing application with business information. Failure to provide&nbsp;payment information may result in processing delays.&nbsp;</li>

<li>A tracking mechanism is strongly recommended if you are mailing a check, cashier’s check, or money order.</li>

<li>DCC does not accept wire transfers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Process to schedule an appointment</h2>
