<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to establish a written allergen control program</h2>

<p>Used in conjunction with the <a href="/2023/09/allergen-guidance/">Allergy Guidance resource</a>, this checklist will assist you in establishing and implementing a written allergen control program as required by the California Code of Regulations, title 4 (4 CCR) section 17214(d)(3), Product Quality Plan.</p>
