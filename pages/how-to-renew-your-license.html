<ol class="wp-block-list cagov-step-list">
<li><strong>Wait for your renewal window to open</strong><br><span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">When the renewal window opens, an automated email will be sent to the email address on record for the licensee’s designated responsible party (DRP). The DRP can renew your license starting 60 calendar days before it expires.</span></li>

<li><strong>Review and update your information</strong><br><span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">Make sure all your information in the DCC licensing system is up-to-date. Check that your documents are current. Ownership and financial interest holder verification is required at the time of renewal. If changes have occurred, please use this form: <a href="/2024/01/notifications-and-requests-to-modify-a-license/">Notification and Request to Modify a License Form (DCC-LIC-027)</a>.  </span></li>

<li><strong>Gather your Gross Revenue documents</strong><br><span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">During renewal, you will need to upload documentation demonstrating your license’s gross revenue for the 12-months of the expiring license to determine the appropriate licensing fee. Gross revenue is your license’s total income for the 12-month licensing period before deducting any expenses.<br><p class="has-inline-color has-black-color">Acceptable documentation includes, but not limited to, a state tax return filed with the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration or a profit and loss statement. If you have multiple licenses that share gross revenue calculations, you may apportion the gross revenue between the different licenses in a manner that is reasonable and accurate, given their specific operations.</p><p class="has-inline-color has-black-color">Failure to report accurate gross revenue may be grounds for discipline. If you pay less than the required amount, DCC may require you to pay the balance of the appropriate fee, plus a penalty of 50 percent of the correct licensing fee.</p><p class="has-inline-color has-black-color"><strong>Note:</strong> Cultivators and Event Organizers are not required to submit gross revenue documentation.</p></span></li>

<li><strong>Submit your license renewal and fee</strong><br><span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">Your current license certificate shows the valid date range and expires after 11:59 PM PST on the date of expiration. To timely renew your license, a completed license renewal, including payment of renewal fee, must be submitted prior to expiration. Fee information can be found on the <a href="/applicants/application-license-fees/">Application and License Fees</a> page.</span></li>

<li><strong>Post your updated license</strong><br><span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">Once your license is renewed, download your updated license certificate. Replace your old license certificate with your new one. Post it in a visible place where visitors to your facility can see it.</span></li>
