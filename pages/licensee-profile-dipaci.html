<h3>Christina DiPaci and Partners</h3>

<p><strong>Caliber Farms<br></strong>Salinas, Monterey County<br>Website:&nbsp;<a href="https://paradisogardens.com/">paradisogardens.com</a><br>Social Media:&nbsp;<a href="https://instagram.com/paradiso.gardens">Instagram</a></p>

<h2>About the farm</h2>

<p>Christina DiPaci and her business partners, Emiliano Acevedo and Zachary Burnham, own and operate Caliber Farms in Salinas. The childhood friends operate three greenhouses, with 210,000 square-feet of cannabis harvested every two weeks. Located in Monterey County, the greenhouses have been renovated and retrofitted to consistently produce quality cannabis flower. In addition to cultivation, the trio collaborate with leading players in the cannabis industry to create innovative products and experiences.</p>

<p>DiPaci and her partners used to operate a medicinal farm in Humboldt County, but in 2016 moved to Monterey County. They entered the legal cultivation market shortly after Californians passed Proposition 64 and now&nbsp;&nbsp;hold licenses for cannabis cultivation, nursery, and processing.</p>

<h2>Commitment to the legal market</h2>

<p>“We’ve put all our money into this company and we’re going to protect it as much as we can—and that includes being compliant,” DiPaci said. “Working with the various state and local regulatory agencies has been symbiotic and fruitful.”</p>

<p>DiPaci gives advice to aspiring cannabis growers whenever she can. Her first piece of advice is to reach out to other licensed growers and ask as many questions as possible. “Immediately after Prop 64, it was survival of the fittest. But through the struggle, we built a great community,” DiPaci added, noting that Caliber Farms’ success is due to an expansive and helpful network of breeders, cultivators, manufacturers, dispensaries, and salespeople. “Tap into that network. Nobody in this industry should feel alone.”</p>

<h2>Proud to be a licensed grower</h2>

<p>DiPaci, Acevedo, and Burnham are proud of California’s cannabis cultivation industry, but they say it’s not always easy. “The hours you have to work are crazy. You have to learn from your mistakes and bounce back from them,” DiPaci said. “You learn so much every day. It’s crazy, but crazy loves company.”</p>

<p>Legal cultivation has made it easier for farmers to share information and knowledge of growing commercial cannabis, DiPaci explained. “Honestly, nobody would share their techniques before but now everyone is working together, in a way. We are all figuring out best practices together.”</p>

<p>As growers, DiPaci said she and her partners care about more than just the plants. “We are rooted in love for our community and our planet. Sustainably grown cannabis—accessible and affordable for everyone—is why we’re here!”</p>
