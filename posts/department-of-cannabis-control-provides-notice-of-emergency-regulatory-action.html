<h2>Notice of proposed rulemaking to readopt emergency regulations for cannabis license fee waivers</h2>

<p>The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) is providing notice to the public of its intent to readopt its emergency regulations implementing Senate Bill 166 which requires DCC to develop and implement a program to provide waivers for cannabis licensing fees, with at least 60 percent of the total amount of fee waivers allocated to fee waivers for local equity applicants and licenses as required by law. The cannabis equity fee waiver program is designed to assist commercial cannabis license applicants and licensees who have been harmed by the War on Drugs. DCC proposes this readoption action to allow emergency regulations, with amendments, to remain in place while DCC continues working to begin the process of permanently adopting the regulations through the regular rulemaking action.</p>

<p>DCC will file the emergency readopt package with the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) after the required five-working day notice to the public. The public comment period, which lasts five-calendar days, will begin when OAL publishes the proposed regulations as being “under review” on its website: <a href="https://oal.ca.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://oal.ca.gov/</a>.</p>

<p>We will share instructions for submitting a public comment and participating in the regulatory process when the comment period opens. Please note that only comments received during the public comment period must be considered.</p>
