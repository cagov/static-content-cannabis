<p>The Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act provides for the Cannabis Advisory Committee to advise the Department of Cannabis Control on the development of standards and regulations necessary to protect public health and safety without creating barriers that would perpetuate, rather than reduce and eliminate, the illicit cannabis market.</p>

<p>The Department intends for the Cannabis Advisory Committee to reflect the diversity of California and the communities impacted by commercial cannabis activity. This includes, but is not limited to, representatives listed in Business and Professions Code section 26014.</p>

<p>Applicants must submit a completed Cannabis Advisory Committee Application form (DCC1102) and resume to CAC@cannabis.ca.gov by January 14, 2022, at 5 p.m. to be considered. All questions must be answered honestly and fully. Failure to do so may result in disqualification or removal from the Cannabis Advisory Committee. Incomplete or late applications will not be considered.</p>
