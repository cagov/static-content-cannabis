<p>Responding to Owner Application deficiencies is very similar to the process above. Any owner receiving a deficiency notification must log into the system with their own, separate account and respond to the deficiency. The related Owner Application has a status of Additional Information Needed, and the deficiency Amendment is listed below that.</p>

<p>Any deficiencies found in the Owner application are listed in the first section. To respond, click the checkbox next to the deficiency and then Edit Selected, or choose Actions/Edit. One of the most common deficiencies is for the Electronic Fingerprint Application, shown here. There may be other deficiencies, including government ID or information related to convictions.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Note: As discussed earlier, any Owner Application deficiency also triggers a deficiency notice on the main application. The DRP must respond to that deficiency notice as well before the license can be issued.</p>

<p>In this document we’ve shown how to respond to License Application Amendments and Owner Application Amendments, referred to as “main application deficiencies” and “owner application deficiencies.” Remember that all amendments (deficiencies) must be responded to and cleared by DCC before your cannabis cultivation license can be issued.</p>
