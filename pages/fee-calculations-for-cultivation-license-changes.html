<h3 class="wp-block-heading">R<strong>educing the size of a cultivation license</strong></h3>

<p>When reducing the size of a cultivation license at time of renewal, the licensee will be responsible for paying the application fee associated with the Original Cultivation License plus the annual license fee associated with the Reduced-Size Cultivation License selected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Example scenario </h4>

<p>A licensee with a Medium Indoor license, chooses to reduce the size of the license at renewal to a Small Indoor license.&nbsp; The licensee will be responsible for paying the application fee associated with the Medium Indoor license, which is $8,655, plus the annual license fee associated with the Small Indoor license, which is $35.410.00.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Placing a cultivation license in Limited Operations Status</strong></h3>

<p>When placing a cultivation license in Limited Operations Status at time of renewal, the licensee will be responsible for paying the application fee associated with the Original Cultivation License plus 20% of the Original Cultivation License fee.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Example scenario </h4>

<p>A licensee that places a specialty cottage outdoor license In Limited Operations Status, at time of renewal, will be required to pay the $135.00 application fee plus 20% of the $1,205.00 annual license fee, which equals a modified license fee of $241.00.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Calculation formula – $1,205.00 Original Cultivation License fee x 20% = $241.00 modified license fee.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fee calculations for one-time changes </h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Making a change to a license expiration date</h3>

<p>When a licensee with a valid processor, nursery, or cultivation license makes a one-time change to the license expiration date, DCC will calculate any credit the licensee is eligible for using a Prorated Daily License Fee.&nbsp; The credited amount will be automatically applied toward the license fee associated with the Modified License Term.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Example scenario</h4>

<p>A licensee renewed their processor license on October 1, 2023.&nbsp; The licensee would prefer to renew their license annually in February and submits a request to make a one-time change the license’s expiration date, on May 1, 2024.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Steps to calculate the license fee</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1: Calculate the Prorated Daily License Fee</h5>

<p>Calculate the Prorated Daily License Fee by dividing the original license fee by 365 days in a year.&nbsp;</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Step 2: Calculate the number of days the licensee used the processor license</h5>

<p>This can be calculated by counting the number of days starting on October 1, 2023, and ending on May 1, 2024.&nbsp; Be sure to count all days including October 1, 2023, and May 1, 2024, which totals 241 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Step 3: Calculate the amount of credit the licensee is eligible for</h5>

<p>Calculate the amount of credit the license is eligible for by multiplying the number of days the original license was used (step 2) by the Prorated Daily Licensee Fee (step 1), then subtract the credit amount from the cost of the annual processor license.</p>

<p>Next, subtract the credit (result from above) from the cost of the annual processor license. </p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Step 4: Calculate the cost of the modified license fee</h5>

<p>Subtract the credit (step 3) from the cost of an annual processor license fee.</p>
