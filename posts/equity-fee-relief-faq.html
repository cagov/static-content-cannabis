<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Q: What does the equity fee relief program provide?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>

<p>A: DCC’s equity fee relief program provides fee waivers and deferrals to qualifying applicants and licensees. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Approval for equity fee relief designates your business as an equity business, connecting you to customers searching for equity retailers via the <a href="https://search.cannabis.ca.gov/retailers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cannabis Unified License Search</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Being designated an equity business also helps DCC develop and implement programs to assist equity businesses.&nbsp;</p>
