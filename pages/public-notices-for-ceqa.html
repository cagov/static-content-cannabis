<p>Under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) may serve as the lead agency for environmental review related to DCC’s issuance of commercial cannabis licenses. As lead agency, CEQA-related documents will be prepared and posted for public notice. We invite agencies, stakeholders, and community members to review these documents and share feedback during the identified formal comment periods.</p>

<p>DCC currently issues commercial cannabis licenses under <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayexpandedbranch.xhtml?tocCode=BPC&amp;division=10.&amp;title=&amp;part=&amp;chapter=&amp;article=&amp;nodetreepath=14">Division 10</a> of the Business and Professions Code and California Code of Regulations, title 4, <a href="https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Browse/Home/California/CaliforniaCodeofRegulations?guid=ICB5239D0543B11ECAE2D000D3A7C4BC3&amp;originationContext=documenttoc&amp;transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)">division 19</a>.

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> At this time, five commercial cannabis sites have been identified as requiring environmental documents under CEQA. Draft environmental documents have been prepared for each of these sites and are now being circulated for public review and comment. These documents analyze the potential environmental impacts associated with the proposed activities, including cultivation, manufacturing, distribution, and/or retail operations, and propose mitigation measures as appropriate. If certified, DCC will use the documents to issue annual licenses for commercial cannabis activities.</p>
