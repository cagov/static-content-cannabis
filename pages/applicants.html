<p>Starting a legal cannabis business in California takes time, effort, organization and planning. To help, we created resources to help you apply for a license and technical guides for the licensing systems.</p>

<p>The documents on this page were created prior to the creation of the Department of Cannabis Control (DCC). Some of them still have logos or contact information for the three former state cannabis programs. We intend to update them with DCC information. You can still use them as resources until we do.</p>
