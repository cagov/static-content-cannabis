<p>This guide outlines the subsequent actions required in the owner application process. It covers key aspects including owner application notifications, live scan applications, and specific sections of the owner application such as contact information, birthdate, place of birth, SSN/ITIN/NIN, ownership information, acknowledgments, and history of convictions. The guide also provides instructions for reviewing and submitting required documents, reviewing the owner application, and managing additional owner applications.</p>

<p>The Department of Cannabis Control’s Licensing Division cannot review the application until 3 other actions are taken:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>All owners submit an Owner Application (covered next)</li>

<li>The Designated Responsible Party submits the Declaration and Final Affidavit</li>

<li>The application fee is paid either online by credit card or bank transfer, by check and mailed to the DCC, or in person (at the office of the one of the DCC offices in Rancho Cordova, Eureka, or North Hollywood). See DCC website for details on <a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/resources/make-a-payment/">payment methods and office locations</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Owner applications</h2>

<p>Important: On receiving the main application, the system sends an email to each additional owner with instructions on how to log in and submit an Owner Application. For new accounts, the owner must complete registration by providing their personal information.<br>(see Part I – Create and Manage Your Account above)<br>All owners must submit an Owner Application. You cannot complete another owner’s application.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Owner application notification</h2>

<p>The Licensing system sends emails to all other owners on the application, instructing them to log into their account (the owner may need to create one first) and complete the Owner Application.<br>Those who don&#8217;t already have a CLS account must complete the registration process.</p>
