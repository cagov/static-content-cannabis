<p>DCC handles complaints related to commercial cannabis activity. If you are looking to make a complaint related to another subject area for which another agency has primary jurisdiction you should work directly with that agency.</p>

<p>Below is an overview of subject areas for which DCC does not have primary authority and the agency that you should reach out to directly for those issues.</p>
