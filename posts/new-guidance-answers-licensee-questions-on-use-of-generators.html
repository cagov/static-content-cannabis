<p>The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) sent guidance on the use of internal combustion engine generators in November 2022 to help cultivators comply with environmental laws and regulations. Many licensees have followed up with questions, so DCC has published additional guidance on its website to help licensees remain in compliance.</p>

<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://cannabis.ca.gov/licensees/cultivation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new guidance on our website</a>.</p>

<p>Cannabis cultivators can use diesel-engine generators if they comply with&nbsp;all applicable&nbsp;laws. These laws:&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Support responsible usage&nbsp;</li>

<li>Limit air pollution&nbsp;</li>

<li>Protect the environment&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>DCC regulations include basic requirements for operating generators and reporting energy usage. However, the California Air Resources Board (CARB), your local Air Quality Management District (AQMD) and your local jurisdiction may have additional generator operating and permitting requirements that you must follow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We strongly encourage you to reach out to your local air quality district and local jurisdiction to understand the rules in place for your specific region. If you intend to utilize a generator to supplement power provided by a utility provider, we also strongly encourage you to reach out to your utility provider to understand their interconnection requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The website also includes detailed guidance about:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
