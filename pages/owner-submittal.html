<p>To complete an Owner Submittal in the CLEaR system, follow the step-by-step instructions outlined on this page. Each owner listed on an application must complete their own Owner Submittal as part of the licensing process. Once all Owner Submittals are submitted, the Department will review your application. Upon approval, you will receive instructions on how to pay the annual license fee, after which your license will be issued.</p>

<p>This guide will walk you through key steps, including entering your application number, submitting owner attestations, and uploading required documents. Make sure to carefully review each section before submitting.</p>
