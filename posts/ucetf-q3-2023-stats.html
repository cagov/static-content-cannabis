<p>CALIFORNIA – Continuing to protect public safety, safeguard natural resources, and advance the integrity of the legal cannabis market, the Unified Cannabis Enforcement Taskforce (UCETF) seized more than $101 million in illegal cannabis during the third quarter of 2023.</p>

<p>Among the highlights from the last quarter were seizures of almost 100,000 cannabis plants and over 61,000 pounds of illegal cannabis. These numbers were accomplished despite serving 65 percent less search warrants in the quarter.</p>

<p>“For the last three months UCETF has been focused on larger, illegal cannabis operations that were a significant risk to the safety of the public as seen by the number of firearms we confiscated,” stated Bill Jones, Chief of the Law Enforcement Division for DCC. “Many of these illegal cannabis operations are linked to organized crime and removing this many firearms should make the citizens of California feel safer in addition to improving the legal cannabis market.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The results of UCETF’s Q3 2023 enforcement actions are listed below:</p>

<p>“Over the past quarter, UCTEF conducted several highly coordinated operations that will disrupt the illegal supply chain. The task force focused on rural areas where illegal cultivators have been conducting unlicensed operations,” said Nathaniel Arnold, Acting Chief of Enforcement for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. “These enforcement numbers represent the hard work and commitment from our multiagency teams. I applaud our officers and partner agencies who worked tirelessly to identify these clandestine operations and provide a good measure of public and consumer safety.”</p>

<p>In 2023 UCETF has seized $263,271,366.44 in unlicensed cannabis through the serving of 173 search warrants. The taskforce has also eradicated 247,627 plants and seized 92 firearms.</p>
