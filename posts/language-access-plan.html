<p>The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) is committed to removing language barriers and ensuring all Californians can access its services. The agency offers free language assistance, including interpreters and translated materials. Key resources are available in multiple languages, included Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Hmong, Vietnamese, and others, with help accessible by phone, email, or online. DCC staff assist with interpreting, translating, and guiding individuals through processes, and there is a clear complaint process with timely follow-up if issues arise.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Introduction </h2>

<p>The California Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency (BCSH) adopted Language Access Plan Guidelines on January 14, 2025. The guidelines require each BCSH department to develop a Language Access Plan. This work is part of ensuring meaningful access to programs and services. As such the Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) drafted its Language Access Plan on June 13, 2025.</p>

<p>DCC will provide access to information, programs, and services to individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP). The plan will ensure that language is not a barrier to accessing licensing, compliance, equity, inclusion, and other services provided by DCC.</p>

<p>In developing this Language Access Plan, we have reviewed:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Our programs and services for the public</li>

<li>The ways we communicate with members of the public and the people we serve</li>

<li>How we currently provide information and services in languages other than English</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Department programs and services</h2>

<p><strong>Mission:</strong> Through innovative policies and effective implementation, the Department (DCC) advances and facilitates a well-regulated, legal market that benefits all Californians.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Programs and services we provide to the public/target population</h3>

<p>The Department licenses and regulates cannabis businesses. We regulate the:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cultivation of cannabis plants</li>

<li>Manufacturing of cannabis products</li>

<li>Transportation and tracking of cannabis goods throughout the state</li>

<li>Sale of cannabis goods</li>

<li>Events where cannabis is sold or used</li>

<li>Labeling of goods sold at retail</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Language access requirements and languages identification</h2>

<p>DCC’s Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Office used one of the following methods to identify the most common languages our Department comes into public contact with:</p>

<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Method 1</strong> (utilized): The Top 5 Languages identified by the American Community Survey Data of the U.S. Census Bureau (C16001). Departments will ensure alignment with threshold languages determined spoken by individuals surveyed under the Dymally-Alatorre Multilingual Services Act (Dymally-Alatorre Act), when applicable.</li>

<li>Method 2 (not utilized)<strong>:</strong> Languages identified by the Civil Rights Act Title VI Four-Factor Analysis.</li>
</ol>

<p>We have also considered any other program-specific laws or requirements. These include but are not limited to: N/A</p>

<p>Please note that this plan does not address DCC’s process for conducting or reporting on the biennial language survey required under the Dymally-Alatorre Bilingual Services Act.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Language Services</h2>

<p>DCC will take these actions to provide information and services in languages other than English.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Direct in-language communication</h3>

<p>Certified bilingual and multilingual staff and/or contracted private interpreters will provide language services to individuals with LEP. Language services will be free of charge. Private interpreter services will not be reimbursed by DCC when visiting our office.</p>

<p>We discourage using unofficial interpreters, including family members or friends. Exceptions for unofficial interpreters include:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Emergency situations</li>

<li>Getting non-essential information, like identifying the person’s preferred language</li>

<li>Public events or when a qualified interpreter is not readily available</li>

<li>Departments that administer licensing examinations may set their own interpreter guidelines, standards, and requirements for examinations.</li>
</ul>

<p>DCC is in the process of contracting for testing of bilingual staff to align with CalHR Human Resources Manual, Section 1003 – “<a href="https://hrmanual.calhr.ca.gov/Home/ManualItem/1/1003#:~:text=The%20State%20of%20California%20requires%20that%20each%20of,with%20limited%20English%20proficiency%20served%20by%20that%20office.">Language Proficiency Scoring &#8211; Bilingual Position Qualification</a>”.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Interpretation</h3>

<p>In publicly accessible offices, DCC has CalHR posters of separate phone lines for multiple languages. </p>
