<p>Recalls are used to remove defective or&nbsp;potentially&nbsp;unsafe&nbsp;products from the market.&nbsp;There are two types of recalls:&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Mandatory recalls</li><li>Voluntary recalls</li></ul>

<p>Mandatory recalls are ordered by the Department of Cannabis Control (DCC). Voluntary recalls are conducted by the cannabis business.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mandatory recalls</h2>

<p>DCC can order a mandatory recall when:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>There is an immediate and serious threat to human life or health, and&nbsp;</li><li>Other remedies would cause an unreasonable delay&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>During&nbsp;a mandatory recall, DCC notifies all licensees who have the affected product. We provide guidance about what to do, and we work closely with licensees to take needed action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Voluntary recalls</h2>

<p>A licensee may conduct a voluntary recall for cannabis or a cannabis products that are adulterated or misbranded. A licensee must notify DCC that the licensee has initiated a voluntary recall. DCC will then work with licensees to ensure appropriate notices are provided and the recalled cannabis and cannabis products are properly handled. Recalled cannabis and cannabis products may be remediated if approved by the department or must be destroyed. After receiving notification of a voluntary recall, DCC also posts the information to the list of voluntary recalls on its website to provide information to licensees and consumers.</p>
