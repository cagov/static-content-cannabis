<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is prop 65? </h2>

<p>Proposition 65, officially known as the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, requires businesses to provide a clear and reasonable warning before knowingly and intentionally exposing anyone to chemicals that are known to state to cause cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm. Businesses should be aware of the levels of harmful chemicals in their products and of applicable Proposition 65 requirements.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Does DCC regulate Prop 65 compliance? </h2>
