<p>CALIFORNIA â€“ DCC will be transferring all manufacturing license and application data from its current PEGA system to the Accela CLEaR system on November 16, 2023. From November 16, 2023, forward, manufacturing licensees and applicants will manage and renew their licenses in the Accela CLEaR system. Any businesses seeking a manufacturing license will also utilize the Accela CLEaR system to apply for the license.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
