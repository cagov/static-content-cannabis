<p><strong>SACRAMENTO —</strong> Today, the Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) released proposed updates to California’s cannabis testing regulations. The regulatory package would revise action levels for pesticide in cannabis products and update the list of pesticides required for testing. These proposed changes are based on the latest recommendations from the Department of Pesticide Regulation and reflect the DCC’s commitment to align testing standards with the most current public health science.</p>

<p>The proposed regulations are now available for public review and comment. Stakeholders are strongly encouraged to visit <a href="http://cannabis.ca.gov" data-type="link" data-id="cannabis.ca.gov">cannabis.ca.gov</a> to review the proposal and participate in the public comment process.</p>

<p>“These proposed regulations reflect health-based action levels recommended by the state’s leading pesticide experts,” said Department of Cannabis Control Director Nicole Elliott. “But smart regulation requires not just sound science—it demands public engagement. These proposals are an important step toward a more transparent and safe cannabis market, and public input is essential to ensure the final standards are both protective and practical.”</p>

<p>The Office of Administrative Law (OAL) ensures that agency regulations are clear, necessary, legally valid, and available to the public. OAL is responsible for reviewing administrative regulations proposed by over 200 state agencies for compliance with the standards set forth in California’s Administrative Procedure Act (APA), for transmitting these regulations to the Secretary of State and for publishing regulations in the California Code of Regulations.</p>
