<p>The Department of Cannabis Control is committed to providing equity to communities harmed by cannabis criminalization. We support local communities who share these values by lifting up practices that are making a difference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Through discussions with equity licensees, we are uncovering the most effective and innovative equity policies from jurisdictions throughout the state. By talking to business owners affected by the War on Drugs and asking them what policies have helped them start or grow their business, we are gathering information about what all of us can do to advance our shared commitment to equity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These promising practices will help local jurisdictions develop equity resources that fit the needs of their local cannabis businesses. These stories will also serve business owners looking for equity programs and can be used by regulators looking for ideas on how to achieve equity goals.</p>
