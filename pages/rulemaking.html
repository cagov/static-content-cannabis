<p><strong>Type</strong>: Emergency rulemaking</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>: Effective September 23, 2024</p>

<p><strong>Department:</strong> California Department of Public Health (CDPH)</p>

<p>CDPH has implemented emergency regulations that explicitly prohibit the manufacture, warehousing, distribution, offer, advertising, marketing, or sale of industrial hemp final form food products intended for human consumption (including food, beverages, and dietary supplements) that contain any detectable levels of total THC or other intoxicating cannabinoids.</p>

<p>Cannabis and hemp are currently regulated in separate supply chains and DCC licensees are not authorized to engage in hemp activities on their licensed cannabis premises. Therefore, these regulations do not directly impact licensed cannabis operators engaged in licensed commercial cannabis activity.</p>
