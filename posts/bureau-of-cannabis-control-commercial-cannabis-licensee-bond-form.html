<p>One of the requirements for the Bureau of Cannabis Control’s annual license application is to provide proof of having obtained a surety bond of at least $5,000, payable to the State of California. The Bureau has released a form for the “Commercial Cannabis Licensee Bond,” which is now available on our website.</p>
<p>Please note that a proof of a surety bond is required for each license application.</p>
