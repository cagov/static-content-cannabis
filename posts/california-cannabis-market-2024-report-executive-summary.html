<p>The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC or “Department”) engaged ERA Economics (ERA) to prepare a report summarizing current market conditions and outlook for the California cannabis industry. The report provides a snapshot of current industry conditions (i.e., economics of the cannabis market) and recent trends. It is structured to provide an overview of factors affecting the supply of cannabis, consumer demand for cannabis, and how these factors are changing over time in California and other markets. This 2024 report also includes an initial overview of the hemp market and how intoxicating cannabinoids derived from hemp are linked to the cannabis market.</p>
