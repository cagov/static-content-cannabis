<p><em>Over $4.3M in illicit cannabis seized</em>.</p>

<p><strong>ORANGE COUNTY —</strong> The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC), in coordination with the Anaheim Police Department and Anaheim Code Enforcement, recently shut down a large-scale illegal indoor cannabis cultivation site located within 100 feet of a school.</p>

<p>The operation resulted in the seizure of 2,626 pounds of unlicensed cannabis and 4,551 cannabis plants, with an estimated retail value exceeding $4.3 million. Two individuals were arrested and eight misdemeanor citations were issued. Investigators also found significant quantities of over-the-counter pesticides and fertilizers, raising concerns about potential misuse. Evidence indicating possible human trafficking was identified and is currently under investigation.</p>

<p>To safeguard public health and safety, Anaheim Code Enforcement determined the site was unsafe to occupy and disconnected electrical service to the building.</p>

<p>“Illegal cannabis operations put communities at risk, especially when operating near schools,” said <strong>DCC Deputy Chief Charles Smith</strong>. “We are committed to protecting Californian by taking aggressive action against this type of activity — activity that undermines the legal market and public safety.”</p>

<p>“The collaboration between the Department of Cannabis Control and the Anaheim Police Department has been vital to improving the quality of life for Anaheim’s residents, businesses, and visitors,” said <strong>Sergeant Matt Sutter of the Anaheim Police Department</strong>. “We are grateful for their efforts and look forward to working together again should the need arise.”</p>
