<p>CDFW will host an online workshop on <strong>April 22, 2022, at 10 a.m.</strong> to provide an overview of the two draft solicitations, application requirements and to answer questions about these two different funding opportunities.

<p>“We are excited to continue to engage with organizations of all sizes to learn about projects that benefit the environment,” said Jeremy Valverde, CDFW’s Cannabis Program Director. “Working together with entities that may apply for these funds, we can make huge strides in protecting our native plants, fish and wildlife, which is a benefit to all in our great state.”</p>

<p>In 2021, through this grant program, <a href="https://wildlife.ca.gov/News?tag=cdfw%27s-grant-program" data-type="URL" data-id="https://wildlife.ca.gov/News?tag=cdfw%27s-grant-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CDFW paid out nearly one million in funds</a> and expects to do even more this year.</p>

<p>Grants through the CRGP are funded through California’s Environmental Restoration and Protection Account pursuant to Revenue and Taxation Code section 34019(f)(2), and may be used to fund the cleanup, remediation, and restoration of environmental damage in watersheds affected by cannabis cultivation and related activities, and to support local partnerships for this purpose.</p>
