<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to establish a written allergen control program</h2>

<p>Used in conjunction with the Allergy Guidance document, this checklist will assist you in establishing and implementing a written allergen control program as required by the California Code of Regulations, title 4 (4 CCR) section 17214(d)(3), Product Quality Plan.</p>

<p>Each manufacturing premises and its operations are unique. Additional controls may be needed to ensure compliance with the regulations.</p>

<p>Following these steps will assist you to establish a written document that identifies the allergens in your facility, identifies the allergens in each of your cannabis products, and details the steps to take to mitigate against allergen cross-contact and the unintentional or undisclosed incorporation of a food allergen into a cannabis product and the unintentional ingestion of a food allergen by a consumer.</p>

<ol class="cagov-step-list">
<li>Identify and document the allergens present in your facility</li>

<li>Identify and document which of your cannabis products contain allergens</li>

<li>Ensure proper storage of allergens and allergen-containing components (e.g., ingredients) [4 CCR <em>§17212(b)(2), (b)(6) &amp; (b)(8)</em>]</li>

<li>Identify and implement production controls to mitigate allergen cross-contact [4 CCR <em>§17208(a)</em>]</li>

<li>Implement labeling controls [4 CCR <em>§17208(a), 4 CCR §17398(c)(3) and 4 CCR §17406(a)(5) &amp; (a)(6)</em>]</li>

<li>Train staff [4 CCR <em>§17211.1 and 4 CCR </em><em>§17211(a)(2)]</em></li>
