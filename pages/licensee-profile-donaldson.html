<h2>About California Street Cannabis Company&nbsp;</h2>

<p>San Francisco native, Drakari Donaldson, owns and operates the California Street Cannabis Company in the Nob&nbsp;Hill and Inner Richmond Neighborhoods of&nbsp;San Francisco. California Street Cannabis Company was the&nbsp;third social equity retail cannabis license to be approved&nbsp;to open in San Francisco and the first under the city’s cannabis equity program. Donaldson’s dispensary supports northern California farmers and producers of quality cannabis products.</p>

<p>Donaldson, raised by his mother in San Francisco, is the first in his family to graduate college. Before joining the cannabis industry, Donaldson was in the restaurant business, working his way up from dishwasher to co-owning a bar in the same neighborhood as his California Street Cannabis Company storefront is today. The key to his success &#8211; love of service, people, and community.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As he prepares to open a third dispensary in San Francisco, Donaldson looks back on his journey, “The key for me has been good mentors and always saying ‘yes’ to the work.&nbsp;<strong>Starting as a dishwasher and now the owner of a dispensary in a matter of 10 years, there were a lot of things I did that other people may not have found value in, but it led me to where I am today.</strong>&nbsp;I differentiate myself by working hard.”</p>

<h2>Benefits of being in the legal marketplace&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Donaldson received his license through the San Francisco Cannabis Equity Program, which fosters equitable participation in the cannabis industry by creating opportunities for those negatively impacted by the War on Donaldson received his license through the San Francisco Cannabis Equity Program, which fosters equitable participation in the cannabis industry by creating opportunities for those negatively impacted by the War on Drugs. For him, being in the legal marketplace means he has a responsibility to support the cannabis ecosystem, staying true to Northern California, and supporting the legal cannabis industry. Most of the products in Donaldson’s dispensaries are sourced from the&nbsp;emerald Triangle and greater northern California&nbsp;region; local products mean less of an impact on the environment.</p>

<h3>Pride in being a licensed retailer</h3>

<p>Donaldson credits much of his success to the mentorship he received from his “Big Brother,” who he’s known since he was 12.&nbsp;<strong>“He taught me that when opening a business in a neighborhood, you should aim to become part of the fabric of that neighborhood, and I have taken that to heart. I am involved in the neighborhood, and I am always looking for ways I can help the neighborhood succeed,”</strong>&nbsp;Donaldson said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The community has embraced us 100 percent and it is my goal to make sure that continues. Getting licensed gave me the freedom to openly involve my business in the community. It provides reassurance to consumers new and old that we do things by the letter of the law and that the products we carry are safe and trustworthy.”</p>

<p>In the spirit of supporting the community, the California Street Cannabis Company launched their Compassion Program, in partnership with a few other San Francisco based organizations, whose mission is to give back to those impacted by the War on Drugs.&nbsp;</p>
