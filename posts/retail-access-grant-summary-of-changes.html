<ul>
<li>DCC published initial grant guidelines for the<a href="/about-us/grant-funding/local-jurisdiction-retail-access-grant/"> Cannabis Local Jurisdiction Retail Access Grant Program on February 14, 2023</a></li>

</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Notable changes</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Logistics</h3>

<ul>
<li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:RetailAccessGrants@cannabis.ca.gov" target="_blank">RetailAccessGrants@cannabis.ca.gov</a> is the new contact email for the program. </li>

<li>A local jurisdiction may apply for Phase II funding regardless of whether it received Phase I funding. Previously, participation in Phase I was a requirement for Phase II eligibility. </li>

<li>Phase I grantees that fail to establish a local cannabis retailer licensing program by October 31, 2025, may still be eligible to apply for Phase II funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Phase II applications will be accepted twice a year, subject to available funds</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Eligibility</h3>

<p>The new Phase II applicant eligibility criteria includes local jurisdictions (city, county, or city and county) that:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Prior to July 1, 2022, did not have a cannabis retailer licensing program in existence; </li>

<li>Has a plan to develop and implement a cannabis retail licensing program; and </li>

<li>Has issued one or more cannabis retail licenses to cannabis businesses within the jurisdiction of the city or county pursuant to that program. </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Funding amounts</h3>

<ul>
<li>Phase II funding amounts for the issuance of retailer licenses increased to <strong>$150,000 </strong>per retailer license and <strong>$300,000 </strong>per equity retailer license issued, subject to available funds. </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Applications </h3>

<ul>
<li>Removed the requirement that a local retailer licensee submit a complete state license application to DCC prior to the release of Phase II funding for the issuance of retailer licenses.&nbsp;</li>

<li>Eligible local jurisdictions may receive awards in Phase II in connection with the following types of retail: adult-use storefront, adult-use delivery, and medicinal storefront. Additionally, jurisdictions that received Phase I funding may receive funding in connection with the issuance medicinal delivery licenses in Phase II. </li>

<li>Jurisdictions applying for funding in Phase II must submit a Retail Access Grant Phase II Application (DCC-2633), Attachment A – License Report (DCC-2634), Attachment B – Budget (DCC-2635) with justification, and copies of all local cannabis retailer licenses issued.&nbsp;</li>

<li>For both Phases, the restriction that approved expenditures only be incurred after the local jurisdiction enters into a Grant Agreement was removed. Upon execution of the grant agreement, eligible expenses incurred within the Grant Term (July 1, 2023 &#8211; June 30, 2026) may be included as activities to be funded by this award. </li>

		<div class="accordion-body">

<ul>

<li>The Table of Contents was adjusted to properly reflect the changes to the document.&nbsp;</li>

<li>References to $20 million being available for award were changed to $10 million to reflect the amount that is available for Phase I. An additional $10 million, including any unused funds from Phase I, will be available for award in Phase II. The overall funding available for award under this program remains unchanged at $20 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Changes were made to clarify that the Phase I Grant Guidelines apply to Phase I. References to Phase II were removed.&nbsp;</li>

<li>Removed the date referencing when Phase II funding will become available for award – this will be addressed in the Phase II Guidelines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>The email address&nbsp;<a href="mailto:grants@cannabis.ca.gov">grants@cannabis.ca.gov</a>, to be used by applicants when communicating with DCC regarding the grant program was changed to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:RetailAccessGrants@cannabis.ca.gov">RetailAccessGrants@cannabis.ca.gov</a>&nbsp;where necessary – the new email DCC is utilizing for this program.&nbsp;</li>

<li>Clarified that detailed explanations and justifications for all proposed expenditures are required.&nbsp;</li>

<li>Removed the requirement that approved expenditures only be incurred after the local jurisdiction enters into a Grant Agreement.

<li>Added a notice to applicants that materials submitted to DCC may be subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act.&nbsp;</li>
