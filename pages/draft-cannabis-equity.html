<p>California’s cannabis equity efforts support people and communities harmed by cannabis criminalization. These efforts lower barriers to the cannabis industry for those hit hardest by the War on Drugs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Listen to our Deputy Director of Equity and Inclusion talk to two Black female entrepreneurs&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/C37ytmXxuMs">in this video</a>&nbsp;about the investments DCC has made toward creating equity in the cannabis industry.</p>

<h2>Effects of cannabis criminalization</h2>

<p>Cannabis prohibition had a devastating impact on Californians and people across the country. The long-term consequences of cannabis prohibition continue to impact:</p>

<ul><li>People convicted of a cannabis offense</li><li>Their families</li><li>The communities in which they live</li></ul>

<h2>Local Equity Promising Practices</h2>

<p>DCC is committed to providing equity to communities harmed by cannabis criminalization and supporting locals who share these values. Local participation, local partnerships and local policies, with state support, will make the difference.</p>

<p>We believe that cannabis equity in California will be achieved through the policies and programs offered in local jurisdictions. Every city and county in this state is unique; and the effects of the War on Drugs in those communities are also unique.</p>

<p>Through discussions with equity licensees, we’re uncovering the most effective and innovative equity policies from jurisdictions throughout the state. We’re talking to the business owners who were affected by the war on drugs. We’re asking what policies have helped them start or grow their business and how we can move the state’s equity commitment forward.</p>

<p>This developing list of promising practices is intended to help anyone interested in taking advantage of equity programs. It’s also a resource for those advocating for equity programs in their community, and for regulators looking for ideas on how to achieve equity goals.</p>

<p>We’re happy to share these stories and DCC is ready to lend support to these local efforts.</p>
