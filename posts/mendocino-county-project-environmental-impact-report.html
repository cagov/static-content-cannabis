<p><em>The public is invited to learn more about DCC’s draft environmental report at an upcoming public scoping meeting later this month.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) intends to prepare an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the Licensing of Commercial Cannabis Cultivation in Mendocino County Project (Project). The Project consists of the DCC actions to approve annual licensing of commercial cannabis cultivation operations in Mendocino County under California Code of Regulations, title 4, section 15002.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The EIR will programmatically evaluate the environmental impacts of the DCC’s annual licensing of commercial cannabis cultivation operations in the county as well as the environmental impacts of future licensed commercial cannabis cultivation operations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As specified by the CEQA Guidelines, a Notice of Preparation (NOP) will be circulated for public review and comment for a 30-day review period. The comment period starts on <strong>August 2, 2023,</strong> and ends on <strong>August 31, 2023</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>DCC will also hold a virtual scoping meeting on <strong>Tuesday, August 22, 2023 </strong><strong>&#8211; 10</strong><strong>:00 AM to 12:00 PM. </strong>Attendees may participate via WebEx online meeting platform or telephone conferencing.&nbsp;</p>
